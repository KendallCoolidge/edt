<h2>Rich UI with Dojo sample</h2>
<p>
Use this sample to learn how to use the EGL Dojo widgets. 
<p>
To get started with the sample, in the EGLSource/dojo.samples directory, open the following files with the EGL Rich UI Editor:
<ul/>
		<li>Gallery.egl - shows how to use each Dojo widget 
		<li>GraphSample.egl - shows multiple widgets on a single page and how to use each graph widget.</li>
		<li>ServiceSample.egl - shows service calls and the service monitor</li>
</ul>
To see the sample in action, at the bottom of the Editor window, click on the <b>Preview</b> tab.  
<p>
For general information, see "Developing with the EGL Dojo widgets" in the Help contents under Developing.</br>
<p>
By default, this sample uses the remote Dojo provider from Google. You can use another remote Dojo provider such as AOL, or 
load the Dojo Toolkit into your local environment. For considerations about which Dojo provider to use, see "Preparation for using the EGL Dojo widgets" in the Help contents.
