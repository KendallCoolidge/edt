/*
 * Updated 2/8/2008 to remove this restriction per Alex:
 * 
 * "However, with EGL V7.1 JSF and Web Transaction support, user can input a fill
 * Character such as  "\unnnn"  for a DBCS or UNICODE item fillCharacter property
 * and the fill character (other than blank) can be handled by JSF or Web Trans
 * output formatting routine at runtime in the application server which is Java based.   
 *
 * I suggest that we should remove the restriction and allow any character to be
 * specified for fillCharacter property on DBCS or UNICIDE item for both JSF and Web
 * Transaction.  Making it more consistent and useful for both component."
