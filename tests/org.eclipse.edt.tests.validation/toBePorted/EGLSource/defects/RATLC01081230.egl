/*
 * Henry Koch:
 *
 * If a call statement has an undefined program as its target, and a flexible
 * record is listed as an argument, validation is flagging the statement as an
 * error and the program containing the statement cannot be generated. The
 * validation messages are VAL 6619 and VAL 6709. It is true that the called
 * program must be an EGL program in this case. However, the called program
 * does NOT have to be defined in order to generate the calling program. It is
 * just that validation of arguments cannot be performed if the program name
 * cannot be resolved. So validation should not be flagging such call
 * statements as being in error.
