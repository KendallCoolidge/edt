//From George: For the problem mentioned below; it is validation error because
//             position information in consoleField is required unless segments
//             is specified.

Record ConsoleFormRecord01 type ConsoleForm
	{ formSize = [10, 20] }
	
	ConsoleField1 ConsoleField {fieldLen = 10};		//1 Unless the property segments is specified, the property position is required for fields of type ConsoleField.
	ConsoleField2 ConsoleField {fieldLen = 10};		//1
	ConsoleField3 ConsoleField {fieldLen = 10};		//1
	ConsoleField4 ConsoleField {fieldLen = 10};		//1
	ConsoleField5 ConsoleField {fieldLen = 10, position=[10,10]};		//0
	ConsoleField6 ConsoleField {fieldLen = 10, segments=[[1,2]]};		//0
end
