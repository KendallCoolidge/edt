5700=The annotation {0} is not compatible with the type {1}.
5701=The number of entries specified for parameterAnnotations must exactly match the number of parameters defined for the function {0}.
5702=The value {0} specified in the parameterAnnotations for parameter {1} is invalid.
5703=The container for the IBMiProgram function {0} is invalid. IBMiProgram functions are only allowed in Programs, Libraries, Services, and Basic Handlers.
5705=The IBMiProgram {0} cannot return a value unless isServiceProgram=yes is specified.
5706=The return type for IBMiProgram function {0} is invalid. The only valid return type is INT.
5707=The length value {0} is invalid for annotation {1}. It must be an integer between 1 and {2}.
5708=The decimals value {0} is invalid for annotatoin {1}. It cannot be less than 0.
5709=The decimals value {0} is invalid for annotation {1}. It must be an integer between 0 and {2}.
5710=A value for the  property {0} must be specified for annotation {1}.
5711=A value for the property {0} is not allowed for annotation {1}.
5712=The value specified for the elementTypeAnnotation is invalid.
5713=The returnCountVariable {0} must have a type that is assignment compatible with INT.
5714=The returnCountVariable {0} must be defined in the same part or function parameter list where the StructArray annotation is used.
5715=An entry in the array of parameterAnnotations is required for parameter {0}.
5716=The annotation {0} is not valid for use with the nullable type {1}.
5717=The type of parameter {0} is not supported in an IBMiProgram function. 
5718=The nullable type {0} is not supported for parameter {1} in an IMBiProgram function.
5719=The array of nullable types {0} is not supported for parameter {1} in an IMBiProgram function.
5720=The parameter {0} references a Handler or Record {1}, which contains the field {2} with the type {3} that is not supported in an IMBiProgram function. 
5721=The parameter {0} references a Handler or Record {1}, which contains the field {2} with the type {3}. Nullable types are not supported in an IMBiProgram function.
5722=The parameter {0} references a Handler or Record {1}, which contains the field {2} with the type {3}. Arrays of nullable types are not supported in an IMBiProgram function.
5723=The parameter {0} references a Handler or Record {1}, which contains the field {2}. The type of this field requires that an Struct type annotation be specified for the field.
5724=The call statement must specify a returns expression.
5725=The call statement cannot specify a returns value, because the function {0} does not return a value.
5726=The return type {0} of the function {1} is not compatible with the type {2} of the returns expression {3} in the Call statement.
5728=The function {0} must be defined with the IBMiProgram annotation.
5729=A "returning to" or "onexception" expression is not allowed for a call to a local function.
5730=An IBM i call statement requires a connection, the using clause and the target function @Resource are missing.
5731=Only a library part can be use as a qualifier.
5732=The target of the Call must be a proxy function.
5733=The specified using clause type ''{0}'' is not compatible with the expected type eglx.jtopen.IBMiConnection.
