<h1 class="title topictitle1">Using the EGL Rich UI editor</h1>



<div class="body" id="body"><p class="shortdesc">You can use the EGL Rich UI editor to modify
a Rich UI handler and to preview the handler's runtime behavior.</p>

<p class="p">Here is an example of an open file in the Rich UI editor.</p>

<p class="p"><br></br><img class="image" src="../images/edt_richui_editor.jpg" alt="EGL Rich UI editor"></img><br></br></p>

<div class="p">The Rich UI editor includes three views: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">As shown in the example, the Design surface is a rectangular area
that shows the displayable content of the Rich UI handler. You can
drag-and-drop widgets from the palette into the Design surface or
into the Outline view and then customize those widgets in the Properties
view. You can also change the placement of widgets by working in the
Design surface or in the Outline view.</li>

<li class="li">The Source view provides an embedded version of the EGL editor,
where you update logic and add or update widgets. The Design view
and Source view are integrated: changes to the Design view are reflected
in the Source view; and, if possible, changes to the Source view are
reflected in the Design view. </li>

<li class="li">The Preview view is a browser, internal to the Workbench, where
you can run your logic. You can easily switch to an external browser
if you prefer.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using the Design surface to create a DOM tree</h2><p class="p">When
you drag a widget from the palette to the Design surface, the areas
that can receive the widget are called <cite class="cite">potential drop locations</cite>,
and the color of those areas is yellow by default. When you hover
over a potential drop location, the area is called a <cite class="cite">selected
drop location</cite>, and the color of that area is green by default.
You can customize the colors in the Workbench preferences.</p>
<p class="p">When
you first drag a widget to the Design surface, the entire surface
is a selected drop location, and the effect of the drop is to declare
the widget and to identify it as the first element in the Rich UI
handler's <samp class="ph codeph">initialUI</samp> property. That property accepts
an array of widgets at development time. The array is ultimately used
to create a DOM tree, which is a runtime data structure described
here: [ to be added] </p>
<p class="p">Specifically, the elements in the Rich
UI handler's <samp class="ph codeph">initialUI</samp> array become children of the
document element, with the order of <samp class="ph codeph">initialUI</samp> array
elements at development time equivalent to the order of sibling DOM
elements at run time.</p>
<div class="p">When you drag another widget to the Design
surface, you have the following choices:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">You can place the widget adjacent to the initially placed widget.
The effect on your source code is to declare the second widget and
to identify it as another element in the <samp class="ph codeph">initialUI</samp> array.
Your placement of the new widget is either before or after the first
widget and indicates where the widget is placed in the array.</li>

<li class="li">If the initially placed widget was a container (for example, a
box), you can place the second widget inside the first. The effect
on your source code is to add an element to the <samp class="ph codeph">children</samp> property
of the container. The effect is ultimately to add a child element
to the DOM tree; specifically, to add a child element to the element
that represents the container.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">Your subsequent work continues to build the DOM tree.
You can repeatedly fulfill drag-and-drop operations, with the placement
of a widget determining what array is affected and where the widget
is placed in the array. The drag-and-drop operation is an alternative
to writing a widget declaration and array assignment in the code itself,
whether in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Source</span> tab of the Rich UI editor
or in the EGL editor. </p>
<p class="p">New widget declarations are added to
the source code before the declarations that were already there; that
is, the order of the statements is opposite to the order of the drag-and-drop
operations.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Using the Outline view to update the Design surface</h2><div class="p">When
you are using the Design surface, the Outline view has special capabilities: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">You can drag and drop a widget from the palette to a specific
position in the Outline view and (therefore) to a specific position
on the Design surface.</li>

<li class="li">Within the Outline view, you can do as follows:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Drag and drop a widget to another position. (If you select a widget
with descendents, the widget and its descendents can be dragged to
another position.)</li>

<li class="li">Delete a widget by right-clicking the widget and clicking <span class="ph uicontrol">Delete</span>.</li>

<li class="li">Update details about the widget by right-clicking the widget,
clicking <span class="ph uicontrol">Properties</span>, and following the procedure
described in <cite class="cite">Setting widget properties and events</cite>. </li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Understanding the transparency options</h2><p class="p">The
Design surface is composed of two layers. The bottom layer is the
web browser, which displays widgets, including initial text values.
The top layer is an editing overlay, including angle brackets at each
corner of each widget.</p>
<p class="p">The background of the top layer can have
any of the following characteristics: transparent, a pattern of white
and transparent dots, or (on Windowsâ„¢ platforms)
a white layer with a varying level of transparency. You can set those
transparency options by setting a Workbench preference, as described
in <span class="q">"Setting preferences for Rich UI appearance."</span> When you are
working in the editor, you can change the transparency options that
are in use for the editing session.</p>
