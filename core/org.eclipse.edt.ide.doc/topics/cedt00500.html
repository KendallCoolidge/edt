<h1 class="topictitle1">Debugging EGL source code in the EDT IDE</h1>




<div id="body"><a name="body"><!-- --></a><p>When you run a program, service, or Rich UI
handler in the EGL debugger, you set a breakpoint to suspend execution
and then run the code in a controlled way. You can investigate the
execution paths in your logic and the changing values of variables.</p>

<div class="p">Also during a debugging session, you can do a “hot” code replace: <ol>
<li>When the debugger suspends execution on a statement, you change
the code that runs subsequent to the statement.</li>

<li>The subsequent code and the debugger behave as if the changes
had been in place before the debugging session.</li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="p">You do most debugging tasks in the Debug perspective. You can access
the following capabilities either by pressing the appropriate toolbar
button or by right clicking in the Debug view and then selecting a
menu option:<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Drop to frame</dt>

<dd>Works with the <dfn class="term">stack</dfn>, which is a list of runtime
functions that contributed to the current execution status. Included
in that list is the <dfn class="term">initialization function</dfn>, which contains
the statements that initialize global variables. <p>The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">Drop
to frame</span></span> command lets you return to the first statement
in any function in the stack, but does not change the values of variables
that were changed since that first statement ran.</p>
<p>The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">Drop
to frame</span></span> command is not available for debugging code
written for JavaScript.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Resume</dt>

<dd>Continues to run your code until the next breakpoint is found
or until the run unit ends. </dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Step into</dt>

<dd>Runs the next EGL statement and pauses. If you issue this command
for a function invocation, execution stops at the first statement
in the function. Similarly, if you issue this command for a service
call and if the Service type is available in the workspace, execution
stops at the first statement in the service.<p>If you invoke code
that is not available in the workspace, the command runs the external
code and stops execution at the first statement where your logic resumes.
In Rich UI, where service invocation is asynchronous, execution continues
at the first statement in the callback function or exception handler.</p>
<p>If
you issue this command for a statement that is the last one running
in the function and if the statement does not explicitly return control
to the invoker or terminate the logic, the debugger pauses so that
you can inspect variable values.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Step over</dt>

<dd>Runs the next EGL statement and pauses. If you invoke a function
or service, the command runs that code and stops execution at the
first statement where your current logic resumes. In Rich UI, execution
continues at the first statement in the callback function or exception
handler for that service. <p>If you issue this command for a statement
that is the last one running in the function and if the statement
does not explicitly return control to the invoker or terminate the
logic, the debugger pauses so that you can inspect variable values.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Step return</dt>

<dd>Runs the statements needed to return to the logic that invoked
the code that you are debugging. After returning to that logic, the
command pauses at the statement that receives control.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Suspend</dt>

<dd>Causes the debugger to pause at the next opportunity. This button
is available only while execution is in progress.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Terminate</dt>

<dd>Terminates the program without running any further instructions.<p>In
the Debug view, the <span class="uicontrol">Terminate and Relaunch</span> menu
option lets you end the run and immediately begin another.</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Use step filters</dt>

<dd>Has no effect when you are working with EGL code.</dd>

</dl>
</div>

<div class="p">If you right click the gray border to the left of a line of code,
the following debugging options are available in the context menu:<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">Disable breakpoint</dt>

<dd>Retains an existing breakpoint so that you recall its position,
but disables use of that breakpoint.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Enable breakpoint</dt>

<dd>Enables a breakpoint that you formerly set and then disabled.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Show line numbers</dt>

<dd>Displays the line numbers in the code you are debugging.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Toggle breakpoint</dt>

<dd>Sets or clears a breakpoint. You can accomplish the task without
opening the context menu, by double clicking on the gray area.</dd>

</dl>
</div>

<div class="p">If you right click in the code that you are debugging, the following
debugging option in available in the context menu:<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Run to line</dt>

<dd>Runs all statements up to, but not including, the statement on
a specified line.</dd>

</dl>
