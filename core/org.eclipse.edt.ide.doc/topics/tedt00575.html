<h1 class="title topictitle1">Setting preferences for EGL Rich UI appearance</h1>



<div class="body taskbody" id="body"><p class="shortdesc">You can customize the appearance of the EGL
Rich UI editor.</p>

<div class="section context">To begin to set the appearance of the Rich UI editor, do
as follows:</div>

<ol class="ol steps"><li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">From the main menu, click <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Preferences</span></span>. </span> The <span class="keyword wintitle">Preferences</span> window
is displayed.</li>
<li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">Expand <span class="ph uicontrol">EGL</span> and <span class="ph uicontrol">Rich UI</span>,
and then click <span class="ph uicontrol">Appearance</span>.</span> The <span class="keyword wintitle">Appearance</span> pane
is displayed with three tabs: <span class="ph uicontrol">General</span>, <span class="ph uicontrol">Browser
size</span>, and <span class="ph uicontrol">Languages</span>..
</li>
<li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">At the <span class="ph uicontrol">General</span> tab, do as follows:</span>
<ol type="a" class="ol substeps">
<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Editor tab</span> section, select <span class="ph uicontrol">Design</span>, <span class="ph uicontrol">Source</span>,
or <span class="ph uicontrol">Preview</span> to indicate which tab to initially
use whenever you open the Rich UI editor.</span></li>

<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Widget creation</span> section,
indicate whether the Rich UI editor must prompt you for a variable
name each time you drag a widget from the palette to the Design surface.
If you clear the check box, the Rich UI editor creates its own variable
name, which is the widget type name (for example, <em class="ph i">Button</em>) followed
by a sequentially assigned integer. For example, the assigned names
might be <em class="ph i">Button1</em>, <em class="ph i">Button2</em>, <em class="ph i">Box1</em>, and so forth.</span>
</li>

<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Transparency</span> section,
indicate how to handle the transparency controls, which vary how widgets
are displayed in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Design</span> tab of the Rich
UI editor. The transparency controls are particularly useful when
you are working on a Design surface with many widgets that are close
together.</span> The Design surface is composed of two layers.
The bottom layer is the web browser, which displays widgets, including
initial text values. The top layer is an editing overlay, including
angle brackets at each corner of each widget. The background of the
top layer can have any of the following characteristics: transparent,
or a pattern of white and transparent dots, or (on Windowsâ„¢ platforms) a white layer with a varying
level of transparency.  The transparency options provided
in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Appearance</span> pane affect the behavior
of the Rich UI editor every time you open the editor. However, when
you are working in the editor, you can change the transparency options
that are in use for the editing session. The options are as follows:<ol class="ol" type="i">
<li class="li">Select or clear the check box <span class="ph uicontrol">Show transparency controls</span> to
indicate whether to display the transparency controls. When you start
working with Rich UI, you are likely to prefer hiding the controls;
this is the default setting for this preference.</li>

<li class="li">Next, select one of the following transparency modes, which affect
the background of the top layer of the Design surface:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Fully transparent</span> means that the background
is transparent.</li>

<li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Dotted transparency pattern</span> means that
the background is a pattern of white and transparent dots. The refresh
rate of your monitor may cause the pattern to shimmer.</li>

<li class="li">On Windows platforms, <span class="ph uicontrol">Variable
transparency</span> means that the background is a white layer
with a varying level of transparency. You vary the level by changing
the numeric value of a slider. The dotted transparency pattern described
earlier is roughly equivalent to the variable transparency pattern
at 38%.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li class="li">The check box named <span class="ph uicontrol">Enable semi-transparency while
dragging</span> allows use of a temporary transparency mode as
you drag a widget from the palette to the Design surface or from one
location on the Design surface to another. Selecting the check box
means that the temporary mode is the dotted transparency pattern.
Clearing the check box means that your usual transparency mode remains
in effect. The check box has no effect if your usual transparency
mode is the dotted transparency pattern.</li>

</ol>
</li>

<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Colors</span> section, specify
details for the following items:</span> <ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Selection border</span>: The border of the currently
selected widget</li>

<li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Potential drop location</span>: Potential drop
locations for a widget being dragged from the palette to the Design
surface or from one location on the Design surface to another</li>

<li class="li"><span class="ph uicontrol">Selected drop location</span>: A potential drop
location over which the widget is hovering during a drag-and-drop
operation</li>

</ul>
 For the border and each location, you can click
the adjacent button to display a color dialog, where you can choose
or refine a color. Also, for the border and the selected drop location,
you can select (or clear) a check box to include (or exclude) the
displayed pattern.</li>

<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Performance</span> section, select
the radio button that reflects your current need, whether for greater
responsiveness or for less usage of runtime resources such as memory.</span>
 One effect of selecting <span class="ph uicontrol">Optimize to use fewer resources</span> is
that you increase the amount of time needed to display content when
you select the <span class="ph uicontrol">Design</span> or <span class="ph uicontrol">Preview</span> tab.
</li>

<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Render engine for the Rich UI editor</span> section,
select the technology used to render a web page in the Preview tab:</span>
 <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">If you select <span class="ph uicontrol">Use default rendering engine</span>,
the effect varies by operating system:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">For a Windows platform:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">If you using Eclipse version 3.7 and have installed Safari, the
Safari installation was accompanied by WebKit, which is the default
rendering engine. However, the following restrictions apply on a 64-bit
Windows 7 platform:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">The Rich UI editor does not support WebKit if a 64-bit Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) is in use. </li>

<li class="li">The editor supports WebKit if a 32-bit JRE is in use, but in this
case you must include the Safari installation directory in the PATH
variable. </li>

</ul>
<p class="p">Incidentally, when Safari is installed in Eclipse version
3.7, running Mozilla XULRunner is problematic. In that case, install
Safari or XULRunner 3.6.2.</p>
</li>

<li class="li">If you are using Eclipse version 3.7 and have not installed Safari,
or if you are using Eclipse version 3.6, the default is Mozilla XULRunner.
However, XULRunner is available only if you do as follows:<ol class="ol" type="i">
<li class="li">Close Eclipse.</li>

<li class="li">Use a text editor to open the <span class="ph filepath">eclipse.ini</span> file,
which is in the Eclipse installation directory.</li>

<li class="li">Add the following as the last argument in the -vmargs section
of that file, specifying an installation directory in place of <em class="ph i">PATH_TO_XULRunnner</em>:<pre class="pre codeblock">-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.XULRunnerPath=<em class="ph i">PATH_TO_XULRunner</em></pre>
</li>

<li class="li">Start Eclipse.</li>

</ol>
<p class="p">Use Mozilla ZULRunner 3.6.2. Also, note that Rich UI requires
the Mozilla Firefox version to be 3 or greater.</p>
</li>

<li class="li">If neither WebKit nor XULRunner is available, the default is Internet
Explorer.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li class="li">For Linux:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">If you using Eclipse version 3.7 and have installed Safari, the
Safari installation was accompanied by WebKit, which is the default
rendering engine in this case. Incidentally, when Safari is installed
in Eclipse version 3.7, running Mozilla XULRunner is problematic.
Install Safari or XULRunner 3.6.2.</li>

<li class="li">If you are using Eclipse version 3.7 and have not installed Safari,
or if you are using Eclipse version 3.6, the default is Mozilla XULRunner.
Use XULRunner 3.6.2.<p class="p">Note that Rich UI requires the Mozilla Firefox
version to be 3 or greater.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li class="li">If you select <span class="ph uicontrol">Mozilla XULRunner</span> and are
working on a Windows platform, you must update your <span class="ph filepath">eclipse.ini</span> file
as described for the first selection. Note that Rich UI requires the
Mozilla Firefox version to be 3 or greater.<p class="p">Incidentally, when Safari
is installed in Eclipse version 3.7, some versions of XULRunner cannot
be loaded.</p>
</li>

<li class="li">Select <span class="ph uicontrol">Trident (Internet Explorer)</span> if you
want to use the Microsoftâ„¢ Internet
Explorer rendering engine.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

</li>
<li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">At the <span class="ph uicontrol">Browser size</span> tab, set the
browser size that is appropriate for a specific kind of device such
as a cell phone. Specifically, you set options that are in effect
whenever you open the Rich UI editor. However, when you are working
in the editor, you can change the browser-size options for the file
being edited.</span> The options are as follows: 
<ol type="a" class="ol substeps">
<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">Select or clear the check box <span class="ph uicontrol">Show the browser
size controls when the editor is opened</span> to indicate whether
to display the controls when a file is opened in the Rich UI editor.
When you start working with Rich UI, you are likely to prefer hiding
the controls; this is the default setting for this preference.</span>
</li>

<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">Change the numeric values of the sliders to specify
the default height and width in pixels. The default you set becomes
the browser size that is provided initially in the Rich UI editor.
Similarly, change the numeric values of the sliders to specify the
minimum and maximum height and width that are valid in any file open
in the Rich UI editor. You can change the maximum and minimum only
by returning to the <span class="keyword wintitle">Appearance</span> pane.</span>
</li>

</ol>

</li>
<li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">At the <span class="ph uicontrol">Languages</span> tab, assign values
that determine what messages to use when you run Rich UI applications
in the Preview tab of the Rich UI editor or in an external browser.
For details on the use of locales, see <span class="q">"Use of properties files
for displayable text."</span></span> Do as follows:
<ol type="a" class="ol substeps">
<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Runtime messages locale</span> list
box, select the locale for the EGL runtime messages, which are provided
by the EGL runtime code and are distinct from the messages included
in a properties file that you customize.</span></li>

<li class="li substep"><span class="ph cmd">In the <span class="ph uicontrol">Rich UI handler locale</span> list
box, select the locale for the messages included in a properties file,
if any, that you customize.</span></li>

</ol>

</li>
<li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">If you want to return the settings on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Appearance</span> pane
to the original product settings, click <span class="ph uicontrol">Restore Defaults</span>.</span>
</li>
<li class="li step"><span class="ph cmd">To save the changes and remain in the <span class="keyword wintitle">Preferences</span> window,
click <span class="ph uicontrol">Apply</span>. To save the changes and exit the
window, click <span class="ph uicontrol">OK</span>. To cancel the changes and
exit the window, click <span class="ph uicontrol">Cancel</span>.</span></li>
