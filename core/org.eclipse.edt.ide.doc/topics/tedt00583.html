<div class="body" id="body"><p class="shortdesc">When debugging a Rich UI application, you use
a launch configuration that is created for you and then move back
and forth between an external browser and the EGL debugger.</p>

<div class="p">You can launch the application in the following ways:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Right-click the EGL file that contains the Rich UI handler and
then click <span class="ph uicontrol">Debug As</span> <span class="ph uicontrol">&gt; EGL Rich UI
application</span>.</li>

<li class="li">If you are working in a source file that contains a Rich UI handler,
you can do the following procedure instead:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Use the workbench toolbar. Either click the Debug icon there or
click the down-arrow next to the Debug icon and then click <span class="ph uicontrol">Debug
As</span> <span class="ph uicontrol">&gt; EGL Rich UI application</span>.</li>

<li class="li">Alternatively, press F11 or use the topmost menu, where you click <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Run</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">Debug</span></span>.</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="p">The debugger opens the application in an external browser. At the
first breakpoint, if a dialog is displayed to ask whether you want
to go into the Debug perspective, click <strong class="ph b">Yes</strong>. </p>

<div class="p">Your task is twofold: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">At every breakpoint, you go to the workbench to work with the
code in the debugger.</li>

<li class="li">As necessary, you return to the external browser to type input.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">In relation to Rich UI, the EGL debugger does not respond to changes
that were made to declarations and logic statements during a debugging
session. However, the debugger does respond to those changes in the
following cases:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">When you debug a service that is invoked from Rich UI and that
is running in the workbench rather than in an application server;
or</li>

<li class="li">When you debug a library that is invoked from a service that is
running in the workbench.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="p">When you want to end the debugging session, click the Terminate
button of the debugger and, if you are not in the EGL perspective,
return to the coding task by clicking the EGL perspective icon at
the top right of the workbench. </p>
