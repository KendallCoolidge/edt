<h1 class="topictitle1">Classifiers for defining prototype parts</h1>



<div><p>A <dfn class="term">prototype part</dfn> is a custom type that holds
the details needed to access a particular kind of logic. Specifically,
the part includes <dfn class="term">function prototypes</dfn>, each of which
is a definition that includes the parameter types, parameter order,
and return type for a given function, method, or service operation.
The prototype part does not include logic.</p>

<p>Here are introductions to the classifiers you can use to define
prototype parts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="cedt00037.html" title="The capabilities of the Interface classifier are made available when you code a Interface type, which has prototypes for some or all of the operations provided by a service. That part is the basis of a service-access variable, which is used in the statement that invokes the service.">Interface classifier overview</a></li>

<li><a href="cedt00038.html" title="The capabilities of the ExternalType classifier are made available when you code an external type, which is the basis of a variable that provides access to non-EGL code.">ExternalType classifier overview</a></li>

<li><a href="cedt00039.html" title="The capabilities of the Delegate classifier are made available when you code a Delegate type, which is the basis of a variable that references an EGL function.">Delegate classifier overview</a></li>

</ul>
