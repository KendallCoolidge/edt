<h1 class="title topictitle1">EGL Syntax</h1>



<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">EGL source code is a sequence of <dfn class="term">tokens</dfn>, which
are the smallest units of meaning. At a more composite level, the
language includes the following constructs: type definitions, expressions,
statements, and set-values blocks.</p>

<div class="p">The EGL tokens are as follows:<dl class="dl">
<dt class="dt dlterm">Identifiers</dt>

<dd class="dd">The names of parts, functions, variables, and constants. An example
is <samp class="ph codeph">myCarCount</samp>, which might be a variable name. For
details, see “Naming conventions.”</dd>


<dt class="dt dlterm">Literals</dt>

<dd class="dd">Fixed values of a given type. Examples are the integer 5, the
string “yes!”, and the Boolean value TRUE. For details, see “Literals.”</dd>


<dt class="dt dlterm">Operators</dt>

<dd class="dd">Symbols that affect <dfn class="term">operands</dfn>, which might be keywords,
identifiers, or literals. An operand is on the left or right of an
operator. For example, the <span class="ph synph"><span class="keyword kwd">&lt;</span></span> operator
is part of a condition that tests whether the operand on the left
has a lesser value than the operand on the right. <p class="p">For details,
see “Operators and precedence.”</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dt dlterm">Reserved words</dt>

<dd class="dd">Identifiers that can be used only in a particular context. For
example, <span class="ph synph"><span class="keyword kwd">add</span></span> is a statement name. For a
list, see “Reserved words.” </dd>


<dt class="dt dlterm">Special characters</dt>

<dd class="dd">Punctuation marks that divide tokens, as necessary for the parsing
done by the EGL compiler. For example, parentheses (<span class="ph synph"><span class="keyword kwd">(
)</span></span>) surround a condition such <samp class="ph codeph">(myVariable &lt;
yourVariable)</samp>.<p class="p">For details, see “Special characters.”</p>
</dd>

</dl>
</div>

<div class="p">At a more composite level, the language includes the following
constructs:<dl class="dl">
<dt class="dt dlterm">Type definitions</dt>

<dd class="dd">Sequences of tokens that define a part. Here is an example:<pre class="pre codeblock">DataItem
   NumberOfCars INT
End</pre>
<p class="p">For an overview, see “Overview of the classifiers.”</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dt dlterm">Expressions</dt>

<dd class="dd">Sequences of tokens that express unnamed instances. For example, <samp class="ph codeph">4
+ 5</samp> might be assigned to a variable, but is itself a value
of type INT.<p class="p">For details, see “Expressions.”</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dt dlterm">Statements</dt>

<dd class="dd">An instruction that causes work to occur at run time or that organizes
code at development and transformation time: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">The runtime work might be variable declaration, data manipulation,
logic invocation, input to (or output from) a user interface or persistent
data storage, and so forth. </li>

<li class="li">The organization work might include assigning types to packages,
importing types from other packages, and enabling a shortcut for referencing
identifiers that are in libraries.</li>

</ul>
<p class="p">Also valid is an empty statement: a semicolon (;) that stands
is in place of an instruction. You might use an empty statement as
a placeholder or for visual clarity.</p>
<div class="p">Most statements begin with
an EGL keyword. For example, the following statement writes “yes!”
to the standard output:<pre class="pre codeblock">SysLib.writeStdOut("yes!");</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">For
details, see “Statements table.”</p>
</dd>


<dt class="dt dlterm">Set-values blocks</dt>

<dd class="dd">Code areas that set annotations and field values and are delimited
by curly brackets ({}), as shown in the following declaration:<pre class="pre codeblock">myCarCount NumberOfCars <strong class="ph b">{ InputRequired = yes, DisplayName = "Number of cars:  " }</strong>;</pre>
<p class="p">The
example set-values block assigns values to the <span class="ph synph"><span class="keyword kwd">InputRequired</span></span> and <span class="ph synph"><span class="keyword kwd">DisplayName</span></span> annotations
for the <samp class="ph codeph">myCarCount</samp> variable.</p>
<p class="p">Set-values blocks
are used in various ways in type definitions, statements, expressions,
and other set-values blocks. For details, see “Set-values blocks.”</p>
