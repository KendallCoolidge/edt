<h1 class="topictitle1">Correspondence between an XML string and an EGL variable</h1>



<div><p>This topic describes the EGL record or handler
that corresponds to an Extensible Markup Language (XML) string. Other
topics describe the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">serviceLib.convertFromXML</span></span> and <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">serviceLib.convertToXML</span></span>functions
that are used by a Rich UI developer to convert XML data to or from
a variable, as might be necessary to access a third-party REST service.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">XML and EGL records or handlers</h2><p>You can
define an EGL Record or Handler type that is the basis of a record
(or array of records) used to process an XML string. The type includes
details that are found in an XML Schema, which is a language for validating
an XML string.</p>
<p>When you use the function <strong>XMLLib.convertToXML</strong>,
you write the content of the EGL record to an XML string. When you
use the function <strong>XMLLib.convertFromXML</strong>, you write the XML string
into the EGL record; and if the string does not fulfill a validation
rule specified in the record, the EGL Runtime issues a <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">RuntimeException</span></span>.</p>
<div class="p">Here is an example XML string,
which is shown on several lines for clarity: <pre class="codeblock">&lt;Employee&gt;
   &lt;EmpNo&gt;10&lt;/EmpNo&gt;
   &lt;Name&gt;Smith&lt;/Name&gt; 
&lt;/Employee&gt;</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">Here is a Record type that matches
the example XML string: <pre class="codeblock">Record Employee {XMLStructure = xmlStructureKind.sequence}
   EmpNo INT;
   Name STRING;
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>In most cases, the Record type includes a set of
field names that each match (in character and case) the name of an
element or attribute in the XML string. If the names do not match,
you use EGL properties to specify the XML element or attribute name.</p>
<div class="p">EGL
support for XML has two aspects: <ul>
<li>Assigning the XML string from a record. If you are converting
a record to an XML string, you can accept defaults when creating the
string or can explicitly specify details such as the name that the
EGL Runtime assigns to an element or attribute in the XML string.</li>

<li>Validating the XML string being written to a record. If you are
writing an XML string to a record, the EGL Runtime issues a <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">RuntimeException</span></span> in
the following cases:<ul>
<li>An element or attribute name does not match an equivalent record-field
name (or does not match an override that you specify in a property
field); or</li>

<li>There is a mismatch in the structure of the XML string and the
related record.</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>Keep in mind this twofold usage: in one case, for XML-string
assignment, and in another case, for validation.</p>
<div class="p">Here is an
example of an XML string that includes an attribute:<pre class="codeblock">&lt;Sample color="green"&gt;&lt;/Sample&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">The attribute value for <samp class="codeph">color</samp> is
stored in a second record. The two Record types are as follows:<pre class="codeblock">   Record root 
    		Sample Sample? {@XMLElement {nillable = true}};
   end
   
   Record Sample {@XMlStructure = xmlStructureKind.simpleContent}
      color STRING {@XMLAttribute{}};
      value STRING;
	 	end</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">The EGL Runtime can read the XML shortcut
(<samp class="codeph">&lt;Sample color="green"/&gt;</samp>), but can write only
the longer form:<ul>
<li>The written output is as follows if <samp class="codeph">root.Sample</samp> is
an empty string (""):<pre class="codeblock">	&lt;root&gt;&lt;Sample color="green"&gt;&lt;/Sample&gt;&lt;/root&gt;
</pre>
</li>

<li>The written output is as follows if <samp class="codeph">root.Sample</samp> is
null and if (as mentioned later) the property field <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">nillable</span></span> is
set:<pre class="codeblock">&lt;root&gt;&lt;Sample xsi:nil="true&gt;&lt;/Sample&gt;&lt;/root&gt;
</pre>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="p">Here is a third example XML string:<pre class="codeblock">&lt;Employee&gt;
   &lt;EmpNo department="Sales"&gt;10&lt;/EmpNo&gt;
   &lt;Name&gt;Smith&lt;/Name&gt;
&lt;/Employee&gt;</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">Here as the two Record types:<pre class="codeblock">Record Employee{XMLStructure = xmlStructureKind.sequence}
   EmpNo EmpNumber;
   LastName STRING;
end

Record EmpNumber {XMLStructure = xmlStructureKind.simpleContent}
  	detypement STRING {@XMLAttribute{}};
   	value INT;
end
</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">Any of the following data types is valid for a
Record field:<ul>
<li>STRING or one of the following types, which are assignment-compatible
with STRING: FLOAT, BIN, or one of the integer equivalents to BIN
(INT, SMALLINT, or BIGINT).</li>

<li>A data item that is based on one of those primitive types.</li>

<li>Another non-structured Record type. The fields of that type are
restricted to the previously stated types or to another non-structured
Record type. A Record type referenced within a Record type can only
include fields of the types listed here.</li>

<li>Arrays of the preceding types.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>Fields of type ANY are not supported.</p>
<p>One Record
type can be referenced from another Record type at any level of nesting.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Nullable fields</h2><div class="p">A record field related to
an XML element may be nullable as indicated by a question mark. For
example, the following <samp class="codeph">EmpNo</samp> field is not nullable,
but the <samp class="codeph">name</samp> field is: <pre class="codeblock">Record Employee
   EmpNo INT;
   Name STRING?;
end
</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">Two rules apply when the EGL Runtime is reading
an XML String into a record:<ul>
<li>If the field (for example, <samp class="codeph">EmpNo</samp>) is not nullable,
the EGL Runtime throws a <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">RuntimeException</span></span> when
trying to read an element that is missing or has no value</li>

<li>If the field (for example, <samp class="codeph">Name</samp>) is nullable,
the EGL Runtime does not throw an exception when trying to read an
element that is missing or has no value; and in the latter case, any
attributes in the valueless element are retained</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>For details on the different ways the EGL Runtime treats
a null when writing a record to an XML string, see the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">XMLElement</span></span> or <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">XMLRootElement</span></span> annotation, <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">nillable</span></span> field.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Type annotations</h2><div class="p">You can use the following
annotations when you define a Record or Handler type: <ul>
<li>The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">XMLRootElement</span></span> annotation provides
naming and data-type details about the root XML element, which is
the topmost, most inclusive element in the XML string.</li>

<li>The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">XMLStructure</span></span> annotation identifies
the characteristics of a set of XML elements.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>You cannot override those annotations when you declare
a record based on the Record type.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Field annotations</h2><div class="p">You can use the following
annotations when you define a field in a Record or Handler type or
when you declare a variable based on that type:<ul>
<li>The<span class="synph"><span class="kwd">XMLElement</span></span> annotation provides details
for a record field that represents an XML element. By default, that
property is in effect.</li>

<li>The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">XMLAttribute</span></span> annotation provides
details for a record field that represents an XML attribute.</li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Namespaces</h2><p>Rich
UI supports reading and writing XML strings that contain namespaces.
 You can reference a namespace in the following annotations: <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">RootElement</span></span>, <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">XMLElement</span></span>,
and <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">XMLAttribute</span></span>.</p>
<p>If the XML contains
a default namespace, you must reference the namespace when defining
the record fields for each XML element in that namespace. Note that
an XML attribute is never in a default namespace; an attribute either
has a namespace prefix or is not in a namespace.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Additional information on XML</h2><div class="p">Many web sites
give background detail on XML and on the most popular XML-validation
format, XML Schema (XSD). Here are a few suggestions that are present
at this writing:<ul>
<li>W3 Schools offers XML and XSD tutorials, which you can access
at the following site, where you search for XML or XSD: <p>             <a href="http://www.w3schools.com " target="_blank">http://www.w3schools.com </a></p>
</li>

<li>Both XML and XSD are covered in <em>SOA for the Business Developer</em> by
Margolis and Sharpe (MC Press, May 2007), which is available from
the following site:<p>             <a href="http://www.mc-store.com/5079.html" target="_blank">http://www.mc-store.com/5079.html</a></p>
</li>

<li>A detailed overview of XML Schema is available from the World
Wide Web Consortium:<p>             <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/</a></p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>To gain a full understanding of the alternatives available
to you in EGL, review the topics for the XML-related annotations.
Also note the EGL Runtime issues an <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">XMLProcessingException</span></span> in
some cases, as stated in “eglx.xml package.”</p>
