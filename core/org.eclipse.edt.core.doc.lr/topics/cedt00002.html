<h1 class="topictitle1">EGL overview</h1>



<div><p>In many ways, EGL is like other programming languages.
It includes familiar constructs such as loops and transfers of control.
It is built on a set of <dfn class="term">types</dfn>, each of which defines
the operations and values that are available for each “instance” of
the type. Last, it involves a process for validating source code and
for converting the source code into a less abstract form, closer to
the runtime need.</p>

<p>EGL is unusual in its reliance on <dfn class="term">stereotypes</dfn>, which
are declarations used by the software that converts the source code
to another form such as Java or JavaScript. These declarations
add simplicity. They let you write similar code even as you code for
different runtime systems.</p>

<p>Other topics clarify what a stereotype is. Also included is an overview
of the EGL types.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The language reference is under development for the 1.0 delivery.
For details on the subset of function that is expected in earlier 
deliveries, see the following web site:<ul class="simple">
