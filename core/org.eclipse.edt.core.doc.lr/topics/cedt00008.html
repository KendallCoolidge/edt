<h1 class="topictitle1">Annotations</h1>



<div><p>When you write EGL source code, you set <dfn class="term">annotations</dfn>.
They are values used by some aspect of the EGL system code, including
the tooling, if any; the EGL compiler; the EGL generator; or the EGL
deployer. </p>

<p>Annotations help ensure that your EGL-created output reflects your
intent. You can set them when you define parts; when you declare variables
and constants; when you code a subset of EGL statements; and, in some
cases, when you declare functions.</p>

<p>For example, when you declare a field in a user-interface form,
you might set a YES value in the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">InputRequired</span></span> annotation.
That setting causes the EGL generator to store a detail in the generated
output, and the detail ensures that the user can submit the form only
if the specified field has content. <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">InputRequired</span></span> is
an example of a <dfn class="term">field-level annotation</dfn>, which is an annotation
that applies to data items and to declarations that are based on simple
types.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Annotation type</h2><div class="p">An annotation represents
an area of memory and is based on an EGL type. To understand these
points, consider the following declaration: <pre class="codeblock">myCarCount NumberOfCars { InputRequired = yes };</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">That
code has effects at two different stages:<ul>
<li>It declares the <samp class="codeph">myCarCount</samp> variable. The appropriate
declaration statement is generated into your output, and the related
instance is available at run time. The type of the variable is <samp class="codeph">NumberOfCars</samp>,
which is an alias of type INT. Here is the alias, or data item:<pre class="codeblock">DataItem 
   NumberOfCars INT 
End</pre>
</li>

<li>The example also identifies an instance that is available at transformation
time. The type of that instance is <samp class="codeph">InputRequired</samp>.
Here is the EGL Record part:<pre class="codeblock">Record InputRequired type Annotation
   value Boolean;
End</pre>
<p>The annotation is the typed value. It is not available
in your runtime code.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>All annotations are based on one or another EGL Record
part. </p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Annotation syntax</h2><div class="p">The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">InputRequired</span></span> declaration
in the earlier source code did not set the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">value</span></span> field
explicitly. The <samp class="codeph">InputRequired = Yes</samp> assignment is
a shorthand form of the following code:<pre class="codeblock">@InputRequired { value = yes }</pre>
</div>
<p>The
at sign (@) indicates that you are declaring an annotation, and the
characters <samp class="codeph">InputRequired</samp> indicate that the annotation
is based on the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">InputRequired</span></span> Record part.
The next characters then assign content to the fields in the annotation.
A later section explains the use of the braces ({ and }).</p>
<p>A
shorthand form such as <samp class="codeph">InputRequired = Yes</samp> is available
whenever the Record part for the annotation has a single field, regardless
of the name of that field.</p>
<div class="p">If an annotation has multiple fields,
only the long form of the declaration is valid, as in the following
example: <pre class="codeblock">@AnotherAnnotation { field01 = "test", field02 = 5 }</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">An
annotation can be based on a Record part that has no fields. In that
case, the mere presence of the annotation is meaningful to the EGL
system code, and only the at sign (@) is required. Here is an example
declaration: <pre class="codeblock">@ThirdAnnotation</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">In many
cases, you can declare multiple annotations, one separated from the
next by a comma. For example, the following code declares the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">InputRequired</span></span> and <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">DisplayName</span></span> annotations:<pre class="codeblock">myCarCount NumberOfCars { InputRequired = yes, DisplayName = "Number of cars:  " };</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Annotation overrides</h2><div class="p">You can declare an
annotation when you define a data item or part, and then override
the annotation when you declare a variable that is based on the data
item or part. Here is a data item with two annotations:<pre class="codeblock">DataItem
   NumberOfCars { InputRequired = no, DisplayName = "Number of cars:  " }
End</pre>
</div>
<p>The following variable declaration overrides
the previous value of the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">InputRequired</span></span> annotation:</p>
<div class="p"><pre class="codeblock">myCarCount NumberOfCars { InputRequired = yes };</pre>
</div>
<p>If
a data item or part includes several annotations and a few are overridden
in a variable declaration, the annotations that were not overridden
are still in effect. In the previous example, the <samp class="codeph">myCarCount</samp> variable
is associated with both the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">InputRequired</span></span> and <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">DisplayName</span></span> annotations.</p>
<p>The
ability to set multiple annotations is particularly important for
data items. For example, a data item might be defined with annotations
that are meaningful for user interface, for accessing a sequential
file, and for accessing a relational database. The benefit of being
able to specify multiple annotations is that you can retain data items
in a library and use those data items for many purposes. When you
use a data item to declare a variable for one purpose such as file
access, the annotations relevant to other purposes such as user interface
have no effect.</p>
</div>

<p>Most annotations have a relatively small effect. For example, the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">InputRequired</span></span> annotation
specifies whether a field in a user-interface form is generated in
one way or another. But a <em>stereotype</em> is an annotation that
affects a series of decisions; the effect is greater. For details,
see “Stereotypes.”</p>
