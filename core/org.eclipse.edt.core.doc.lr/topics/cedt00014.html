<h1 class="topictitle1">EGL packages</h1>



<div><p>An <dfn class="term">EGL package</dfn> is a container of EGL parts,
each of which has a name that is unique to the package. For example,
a program and a data item of the same name cannot be in the same package.
In general terms, the package is a <dfn class="term">namespace</dfn>, which is
a container in which the immediately subordinate names are unique.</p>

<p>The package corresponds to a set of subfolders in a directory.
The subfolders correspond to the package name.</p>

<h2 class="topictitle2">Package names</h2>

<div>
<div class="p">A package name is a sequence of names with intervening periods
(.). Here is an example: <pre class="codeblock">com.myOrg.myPkg</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">Each name is that of a subfolder in a hierarchy. The hierarchy
for the current example is expressed as follows on a Windows platform:<pre class="codeblock">com\myOrg\myPkg</pre>
</div>

<p>The EGL parts are in files in the bottommost subfolder; here, the <samp class="codeph">myPkg</samp> subfolder.</p>

<p>You might invert the list of qualifiers in your company's
Internet domain name and assign the resulting list to the start of
your package names. For example, if the domain name is <span class="filepath">mycompany.mydivision.mydepartment.com</span>,
you might start your package names with <span class="filepath">com.mydepartment.mydivision.mycompany</span>.
This convention is often used, and a benefit is that your packages
will be unique even if your company merges or collaborates with another. </p>

<p>Package names are case sensitive; <samp class="codeph">myPkg</samp> is different
from <samp class="codeph">MYpkg</samp>.</p>

<p>Although a package corresponds to a set of subfolders, an EGL package
is a collection of parts. The subfolders and related files represent
only how those parts are stored.</p>

<h2 class="topictitle2">Package statement</h2>

<div>
<div class="p">Each EGL source file in a named package must start with a statement
that identifies the package. The statement provides a kind of documentation,
as in the following example:<pre class="codeblock">package myPkg;</pre>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="nested1" xml:lang="en-us" id="defaultpackage"><a name="defaultpackage"><!-- --></a>
<h2 class="topictitle2">Default package</h2>

<div>
<p>An Eclipse project includes a <dfn class="term">default package</dfn>, which
is a package that has no name. Other packages cannot access the parts
that are defined in a default package. It is generally recommended
that you not use a default package because doing so limits the future
use of your code by other code.</p>

<p>When you use a default package, the directory that contains the
package includes all the EGL source files that are in that package.
In this case, a source file does not start with a <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">package</span></span> statement.</p>
