<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The <dfn class="term">run unit</dfn> is composed of a set of logical
units that are derived from EGL parts, are located on the same system,
and refer to each other through direct references, transfers to programs,
and local calls.</p>

<p class="p">All of the logic in a run unit share resources such as files and
database connections. Also, if a runtime exception occurs that is
not handled by a member of the run unit, the run unit ends.  A member
can handle the exception, as can the member's caller or the caller
of that caller, to any level.</p>

<p class="p">In Java™, a run unit also
has a set of properties that help determine the runtime behavior.
 The properties are loaded when the run unit starts and do not change
during its lifetime.  The properties are loaded from properties files
or a JEE deployment descriptor, depending on where the code is running.</p>

<p class="p">In JavaScript™, a run
unit is the runtime application, including all JavaScript that is downloaded to the browser
and executed.</p>
