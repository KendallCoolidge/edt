<h1 class="topictitle1">EGL types</h1>



<div><p>EGL provides several native types, and a language extender
can add more. The most elemental are the <em>simple native types</em>.
They have no sub-fields and can be categorized as follows:</p>

<div class="p"><ul>
<li>Character types</li>

<li>Date and time types</li>

<li>Large object types</li>

<li>Numeric types</li>

<li>The logical BOOLEAN type, which is the basis of an instance that
resolves to true or false</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">Other native types have sub-fields:<ul>
<li><dfn class="term">List types</dfn>, which you can use to define one or another
type of <dfn class="term">list</dfn>. A list is composed of an ordered sequence
of elements that can be changed at run time, whether to change the
content of a specific element or to increase or decrease the number
of elements.</li>

<li><em>Enumeration types</em>, which are categories that you can use
to define a named value. For example, a system-provided enumeration
is ColorKind, and valid values include <samp class="codeph">ColorKind.red</samp> and <samp class="codeph">ColorKind.white</samp>.</li>

<li><em>System libraries</em>. which include functions, variables, and
constants that you can access in your own logic.</li>

<li>ANY, which you can use as the basis of a field that has the following
characteristic: it can reference an instance of one type at one point
in your logic but then reference an instance of a second type at another
point.</li>

<li><em>Dictionary type</em>, which you can use to define a <em>dictionary</em>.
A dictionary is an instance of key-value pairs that can be changed
at run time, whether to change a specific value or to change the number
of pairs. Each value is of type ANY.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>As an EGL developer, you can create <strong>parts</strong>, which are types
that are specific to your set of applications. For example, you might
create a part named <samp class="codeph">EmployeeRecordPart</samp>, from which
you create an instance that has data on a specific employee.</p>

<p>The native types are further described in "Class classifier overview.‚Äù</p>
