<h1 class="topictitle1">Interface classifier overview</h1>



<div><p>The capabilities of the Interface classifier are made available
when you code a <dfn class="term">Interface part</dfn>, which has prototypes
for some or all of the operations provided by a service. That part
is the basis of a <dfn class="term">service-access variable</dfn>, which is used
in the statement that invokes the service.</p>

<p>A second use of the Interface part is as a design tool.</p>

<h2 class="topictitle2">The Interface part as a custom type</h2>

<div>
<p>If you accessing a service written in a language other than EGL,
you must use an Interface part to declare the service-access variable.
If you are accessing a service written in EGL, you can use either
an Interface part or the related Service part to declare the variable. </p>

<div class="p">If you are writing an EGL service and want to distribute details
to those who are developing a service requester, you might distribute
an Interface part to avoid disclosing the logic inside the service:<ul>
<li>You might want to hide the source code from developers outside
of your organization. In particular, you might ship EGL Interface
parts to customers, along with the Java classes
that were generated from the Service part.</li>

<li>You might want to reduce complexity. The Interface part helps
developers focus on the service operations rather than on the internal
logic.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">Here is an example Interface part, which is based on the service
shown in “The Service classifier”:<pre class="codeblock">Interface IMyService
   Function calculate(theList INT[] IN) 
            returns(BIN (4,2));

   // other function prototypes are here
end
</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">Here is the declaration of the service-access variable:<pre class="codeblock">myServiceVariable IMyService;
</pre>
</div>

<p>In this case, you also must declare a variable that is based on <samp class="codeph">BIN
(4,2)</samp>, which is the return type. </p>

<div class="p">Two cases apply:<ul>
<li>If you are writing EGL code to be generated into Java, the service invocation is <dfn class="term">synchronous</dfn>,
which means that the invoking logic waits for the service to return
control. Here is the code that sets up and fulfills the invocation:<pre class="codeblock">average BIN(4,2);
average = myServiceVariable.calculate([90, 70, 80]);</pre>
</li>

<li>If you are writing EGL code to be generated to JavaScript, the service invocation is <dfn class="term">asynchronous</dfn>,
which means that the invoking logic continues running. The EGL runtime
code directs the service-response data to one of the following functions:<ul>
<li>A <dfn class="term">callback function</dfn>, which is a function that is
coded to receive the return value after a successful invocation.</li>

<li>An <dfn class="term">exception handler</dfn>, which is a function that is
coded to receive error details after a failed invocation.</li>

</ul>
<div class="p">Here is the code that invokes the service asynchronously from
a Rich UI handler:<pre class="codeblock">   call myServiceVariable.calculate([90, 70, 80])
      returning to myCallbackFunction 
                   onException ServiceLib.serviceExceptionHandler;</pre>
</div>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>A service-access variable is tied to a <dfn class="term">service binding</dfn>,
which is a definition that identifies the service location and access
protocol. The binding can be in the deployment descriptor, and that
practice provides the greatest flexibility. If you are invoking a
web service, you can set the binding in the code itself.</p>

<p>An Interface part does not include a stereotype.</p>

</div>

</div>

<h2 class="topictitle2">The Interface part as a design tool</h2>

<div>
<p>You can also use an Interface part to describe the functionality
that you want to see coded in an EGL service. After the Interface
part is complete, you or others can code the service, which is said
to <em>implement the interface</em>. The meaning of that phrase is that
the service contains every function described in the Interface part.
The part provides a kind of contract that the service must fulfill.</p>

<div class="p">Using an Interface part as a design tool has the following benefits:<ul>
<li>Helps developers and business analysts think clearly about what
operations are needed in a service before service development begins.</li>

<li>Helps developers write the service-access code while the service
is under development.</li>

</ul>
