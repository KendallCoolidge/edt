<h1 class="topictitle1">Stereotypes</h1>



<div><p>A stereotype is an annotation that you set to communicate
a major decision to the EGL compiler; in most cases, to the generator
invoked by the compiler. In response to the annotation, the EGL system
code creates output that acts <dfn class="term">stereotypically</dfn>, that is,
in accordance with a pattern. The pattern differs from one stereotype
to another. </p>

<div class="p">The difference in generated output is often related to the statements
you code. The following example clarifies the idea and includes reference
to the stereotypes <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">CSVRecord</span></span> and <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">SQLRecord</span></span>,
which are available only in a commercial product: <ul>
<li>You might define a Record part that is the basis of a record used
during sequential-file access. In this case, statements such as <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">add</span></span> and <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">update</span></span> do
file I/O.<div class="p">Here is the Record part, which is stereotyped by the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">CSVRecord</span></span> stereotype: <pre class="codeblock">Record MyCSVRecordPart <strong>type CSVRecord
                            {  fileName = "employ", delimiter = "," }</strong>
   employeeID INT;
   employeeName STRING;
   salary DECIMAL(7,2);
end</pre>
</div>
<p>The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">fileName</span></span> field
refers to a value that you make available used at generation time.
That value identifies the file used at run time, and the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">delimiter</span></span> field
indicates how one value in the file is separated from the next.</p>
</li>

<li>Alternatively, you might define a Record part that is the basis
of a record used during relational-database access. In this case,
statements such as <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">add</span></span> and <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">update</span></span> access
a database management system.<div class="p">Here is the Record part, which is
stereotyped by the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">SQLRecord</span></span> stereotype:<pre class="codeblock">Record EmployeeType <strong>type SQLRecord 
                         { tableNames = [["employee"]], keyItems = [employeeID] }</strong>

   employeeID INT      { Column     = "empid" };
   employeeName STRING { Column     = "empname"};
   salary DECIMAL(7,2) { Column     = "salary"};
end</pre>
</div>
<p>The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">tableNames</span></span> field
references a database table, and the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">keyItems</span></span> field
indicates which fields are referencing a table key.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>In both the preceding examples, the word “type” is an abbreviation
for “stereotype.”</p>

<div class="p">To see that a stereotype is a kind of annotation, compare the earlier
 of <samp class="codeph">MyCSVRecord</samp> with the following, equivalent one: <pre class="codeblock">Record MyCSVRecordPart <strong>{@CSVRecord {fileName = "employ", delimiter = ","}}</strong>
   employeeID INT;
   employeeName STRING;
   salary DECIMAL(7,2);
end</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">Although the second, longer form is rarely used, the at sign (@)
again declares a value used by the EGL system code. In this case,
the declaration is based on the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">CSVRecord</span></span> Record
part, which includes several fields:<pre class="codeblock">Record CSVRecord type Stereotype
   fileName STRING;
   delimiter CHAR(1);
   ...
end</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">You declare a stereotype only when you define a part. If the part
can include fields, the stereotype identifies a set of <dfn class="term">member
annotations</dfn>, which are annotations that apply to those fields.
For example, consider the <samp class="codeph">EmployeeType</samp> Record part
again:<pre class="codeblock">Record EmployeeType type SQLRecord 
                         { TableNames = [["EMPLOYEE"]], KeyItems = [employeeID] }

   employeeID INT      { <strong>Column     = "EMPID"</strong> };
   employeeName STRING { <strong>Column     = "EMPNAME"</strong>};
   salary DECIMAL(7,2) { <strong>Column     = "SALARY"</strong>};
end</pre>
</div>

<p>The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">Column</span></span> annotation relates the <samp class="codeph">employeeID</samp>, <samp class="codeph">employeeName</samp>,
and <samp class="codeph">salary</samp> fields with relational-database table
columns; specifically, with the <samp class="codeph">EMPID</samp>, <samp class="codeph">EMPNAME</samp>,
and <samp class="codeph">SALARY</samp> columns. The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">SQLRecord</span></span> stereotype
causes the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">Column</span></span> annotation to be available
in any Record part that is defined with the stereotype.</p>

<p>Each classifier such as Record or Program supports zero to many
stereotypes. You select from the list when you define a custom part.</p>
