<h1 class="topictitle1">Types and instances of those types</h1>



<div><p>Types are central to EGL technology and are meaningful
at development time, transformation time, and run time.</p>

<p>In general usage, a type such as <em>integer</em> or <em>string</em> identifies
a set of values and a set of operations that can be applied to those
values. For example, integers are whole numbers that can be added,
subtracted, and so forth; and strings are character sequences that
can be shortened, lengthened, and so forth. The number 5 is a <dfn class="term">value</dfn> of
an integer and is also said to be an <dfn class="term">instance</dfn> of an integer.
Similarly, the phrase “yes!” is a value and an instance of a string.
In the most general sense, the terms “value” and “instance” are interchangeable.</p>

<p>In EGL, a <dfn class="term">field declaration</dfn> is a statement that identifies
a memory area available to your code. The area either contains or
references an instance of a given type. For details on the distinction
between containing and referencing, see “Value and reference types.”</p>

<div class="p">Here are example declarations:<pre class="codeblock">// variable declarations
myString  STRING;                   // a string
myInteger INT;                      // an INT, or integer 
myNumber  DECIMAL(5,2) = 123.45;    // a number with decimal point

// constant declarations
const MYSTRING01  STRING = "Value";
const MYINTEGER01 INT = 5;
const MYNUMBER01  DECIMAL(5,2) = 123.45;
</pre>
</div>

<p>Each of the first set of statements declares a <dfn class="term">variable</dfn>,
which identifies a memory area that you can change in subsequent statements.
Each of the second set of statements declares a <dfn class="term">constant</dfn>,
which identifies a memory area that you cannot change in subsequent
statements.</p>

<p>For ease of coding, EGL is typically not case sensitive. Exceptions
to this rule involve strings such as program names, which are in the
source code and are also visible in the runtime system.</p>

<div class="p">However, the following conventions are in use in this documentation
and are often in use among EGL developers:<ul>
<li>Lowercase the first letter in a variable name, and uppercase any
letter than begins a new, human-language word.</li>

<li>Uppercase all the letters in a constant.</li>

</ul>
