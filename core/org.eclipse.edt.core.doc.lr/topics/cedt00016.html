<h1 class="topictitle1">Name resolution at run time</h1>



<div><p>The rules for name resolution at run time tell whether
a given variable, constant, parameter, or function is visible to an
expression. These rules concern <dfn class="term">scope</dfn>, which is a definition
of the code area from which a given memory area is accessible.</p>

<div class="p">The order of priority for resolving references at run time is as
follows:<ol>
<li>First in precedence are declarations that are local to the function
where the expression resides. This category includes the local variable,
constant, and function-parameter declarations.</li>

<li>Second in precedence are declarations that are outside of a function
but are inside the part where the expression resides. Each field is <dfn class="term">program
global</dfn>, which means that it is accessible to all functions
in the part. This category includes the global variable, constant,
program-parameter, and function declarations.</li>

<li>Third are declarations that are outside a function but are inside
a library that is accessible to the expression. Each public field
is <dfn class="term">run-unit global</dfn>, which means that it is accessible
to all functions in the run unit. This category includes the variable,
constant, and function declarations in the library. Those declarations
are program global to other functions in the same library.</li>

<li>Fourth are declarations that are in EGL system libraries.</li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="p">A reference in an expression can include a series of identifiers,
with a period (.) separating one from the next. Here is an expression
in which each operand is fully qualified: <pre class="codeblock">autoPkg.AutoLibrary.numberInFleet - autoPkg.CarLibrary.DebtRecord.carLimit</pre>
</div>

<p>As appropriate, the identifiers can include a package name, a part
name, a declaration name (for example, for a record), and a member
name such as the name of a record field.</p>

<p>The package name and part name are especially useful for accessing
values and functions in a library, as suggested in the example. However,
you can code the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">use</span></span> statement for the convenience
of referring more directly to the declarations in a library. For details,
see “Use statement.”</p>

<p>If a local declaration has the same name as the program-global
declaration, only the local declaration is visible to the expression;
but you can override that rule. For details, see “This keyword.”</p>
