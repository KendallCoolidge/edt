<h1 class="topictitle1">Classifiers, or part types</h1>



<div><p>EGL provides a variety of <dfn class="term">classifiers</dfn>, each
of which is a category of types. The EGL documentation sometimes refers
to a classifier as a <dfn class="term">part type</dfn>, but the word “type” in
that phrase means “kind” rather than “data type.”</p>

<p>If you are interested in understanding how the EGL generator works,
you can start by noting that each EGL part is an instance of a classifier.
In any case, be aware that the capabilities of a given classifier
are made available to your EGL code when you define or use a part
that is based on that classifier:</p>

<div class="p"><ul>
<li>You might define a part. For example, the <samp class="codeph">EmployeeRecordType</samp> type
is in the category of Record classifiers, and the <samp class="codeph">PromoteEmployee</samp> program
is in the category of Program classifiers.</li>

<li>You might declare a field that is of a native type other than
a simple one. For example, if you declare a dictionary named <samp class="codeph">myDictionary</samp>,
you have declared a variable of type Dictionary. In essence, the Dictionary
type is a part that is defined for you. The Dictionary type is in
the category of Class part types.</li>

<li>You might use a native-type field that is defined for you. For
example, if you use the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">ColorKind.blue</span></span> enumeration
value, you are referencing the ColorKind type. In essence, the ColorKind
type is a part that is defined for you. The part is static, which
implies that you do not declare a variable to use that part in your
EGL logic. The ColorKind type is in the category of Enumeration classifiers.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">Each of the EGL parts that you develop has some or all of the following
characteristics, depending on the classifier:<ul>
<li>A header, which is always required. The header includes a name
and, in many cases, a stereotype.</li>

<li>The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">end</span></span> keyword, which is always required
to terminate the part.</li>

<li>A set of members:<ul>
<li>Fields, each of which is based on either a native part of a user-defined
part.</li>

<li>Functions, each of which is a logical unit that is equivalent
to a function or method in another language. However, functions do
not embed other functions.</li>

<li>Constructors, each of which is a logical unit that creates an
instance of a reference type.</li>

</ul>
<p>The members in a part are typically accessible in the same
part. However, if you declare a field, function, or constructor to
be <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">private</span></span>, the member is protected from
external access and can be accessed only within the same part. If
you do not declare a member to be private, it is said to be <dfn class="term">public</dfn>.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">One classifier is <dfn class="term">Record</dfn>. It enables you to define
a part with multiple fields. For example, you might use this classifier
to define a part named <samp class="codeph">CarPolicy</samp>:<pre class="codeblock">Record CarPolicy type BasicRecord {}
   thePolicyID STRING; 
   theCarCount NumberOfCars;
   theDriverCount NumberofDrivers;
end</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">You can use a part such as <samp class="codeph">CarPolicy</samp> to declare
a variable named <samp class="codeph">myCarPolicy</samp>:<pre class="codeblock">myCarPolicy CarPolicy;</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">The variable is called a record, and you can now assign data to
each of its fields: <pre class="codeblock">myCarPolicy.thePolicyID    = "ABC123";
myCarPolicy.theCarCount    = 2;
myCarPolicy.theDriverCount = 2;</pre>
</div>

<div class="p">Another EGL classifier is <dfn class="term">Program</dfn>. You use this part
type to define a <dfn class="term">static type</dfn>, which is a unit that is
not the basis of a variable. For example, here is the program part <samp class="codeph">AssignPolicyValues</samp>:<pre class="codeblock">Program AssignPolicyValues
   
   myCarPolicy CarPolicy;
   const CONSTANT_TWO INT = 2;

   function main()
      myCarPolicy.thePolicyID    = "ABC123";
      myCarPolicy.theCarCount    = CONSTANT_TWO;
      myCarPolicy.theDriverCount = CONSTANT_TWO;
   end
end</pre>
</div>

<p>The Program part <samp class="codeph">AssignPolicyValues</samp> is a single
unit that embeds fields and functions. Those fields and functions
are <dfn class="term">program global</dfn>, which means that they are accessible
from every function in the part.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the EGL documentation often drops the word “part”
when referring to a part that is based on a classifier other than
Record. For example, <samp class="codeph">AssignPolicyValues</samp> is said to
be a “program” rather than a “Program part.”</p>
