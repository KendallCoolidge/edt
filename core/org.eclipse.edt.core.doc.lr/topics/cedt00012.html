<h1 class="topictitle1">Value and reference types</h1>



<div><p>Value types are the basis of memory areas that <em>contain</em> business
values. Reference types are the basis of data areas that <em>reference</em> business
values. When you are copying data to or from a variable, you sometimes
need to know the low-level details.</p>

<div class="p">Consider the following declarations:<pre class="codeblock">// variable declaration
NumberOfCars INT;

// constant declaration
const MINIMUMNUMBER INT = 2;
</pre>
</div>

<p>The type is each case is INT, which is a value type. The first
statement declares a <dfn class="term">value variable</dfn>, the second declares
a <dfn class="term">value constant</dfn>. In either case, the term <dfn class="term">instance</dfn> refers
to the value in the memory area itself.</p>

<div class="p">For a second example, you might declare a list of five integers
by coding a statement like one of these:<pre class="codeblock">// variable declaration
NumberOfVehicles INT[5];

// constant declaration
const MINIMUMNUMBERS INT[5] = [1,2,3,4,5];</pre>
</div>

<p>The type in this case is INT List or INT[], which is a reference
type. The first statement declares a <dfn class="term">reference variable</dfn>,
which means that you can assign a different list to <samp class="codeph">NumberOfVehicles</samp> in
a later assignment. Incidentally, you can also change the values inside
the list and can change the number of elements.</p>

<p>The second statement declares a <dfn class="term">reference constant</dfn>,
which means that you cannot assign a different list to <samp class="codeph">MINIMUMNUMBERS</samp> in
a later assignment. However, even in this case, you can alter the
values inside the list and can change the number of elements.</p>

<div class="p">The behavior is consistent because each declaration in the second
example identifies a memory area that contains an address of a second
memory area. The constant is only constant in the sense that the area
identified as <samp class="codeph">MINIMUMNUMBERS</samp> must always contain
the same address, which refers to the same list. The following, subsequent
assignment is not valid even though the values are the same: <pre class="codeblock">// An invalid assignment
MINIMUMNUMBERS = [1,2,3,4,5];  </pre>
</div>

<p>In relation to a reference variable or constant, the term <dfn class="term">instance</dfn> refers
to the value in the secondary memory area; that is, in the memory
area to which the variable or constant refers.</p>

<p>Some simple types are expressed with parameters. For example, DECIMAL
is a numeric type and can be restricted by parameters that define
a second type such as DECIMAL(4).</p>

<p>With one exception, the following rule applies: If a simple type
can be expressed with parameters, the non-parameterized type such
as DECIMAL is a reference type, and the parameterized type such as
DECIMAL(4) is a value type. The one exception is STRING and its parameterized
equivalent: Both STRING and STRING(4) are reference types.</p>

<p>A variation in the assignment rules described earlier is in effect
for simple-type fields. For details, see “Boxing and unboxing conversions.”</p>
