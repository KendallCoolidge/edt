<h1 class="topictitle1">Part-name resolution</h1>



<div><p>The rules for part-name resolution specify the search order
that the compiler follows to resolve a part reference; for example,
in a variable declaration. The compiler considers the current package
directory, the repositories in the EGL build path, and the EGL system
package. The compiler stops the search only when the same-named part
is found or, if no part is found, only after all locations are searched.</p>

<p>The rest of this description assumes that the compiler is seeking
the <samp class="codeph">myPart</samp> part in the <samp class="codeph">myPkg</samp> package.</p>

<p>Here are the rules:</p>

<div class="p"><ol>
<li>If the reference is fully qualified, as in the case of <samp class="codeph">myPkg.myPart</samp>,
the compiler seeks the part in the current directory and then in every
repository in the EGL build path. The search through the repositories
is in <dfn class="term">build-path order</dfn>, which is the order in which the
repositories are listed in the <dfn class="term">eglpath</dfn> parameter. After
reviewing every repository in that list, the search considers the
EGL system package.</li>

<li>If the reference is not fully qualified, as in the case of <samp class="codeph">myPart</samp>,
the compiler gives priority to the following packages, in order:<ol type="a">
<li>The package identified in a one-part <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">import</span></span> statement
such as the following:<pre class="codeblock">import myPkg.myPart; </pre>
<p>The
compiler seeks the part in the current directory; then in every repository
in the EGL build path, in build-path order; and then in the EGL system
package.</p>
</li>

<li>The current package.<p>The compiler seeks the part in the current
directory and then in every repository in the EGL build path, in build-path
order. </p>
</li>

<li>The package identified in an on-demand <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">import</span></span> statement
such as the following:<pre class="codeblock">import myPkg.*; </pre>
<p>The
compiler seeks the part in the current directory and then in every
repository in the EGL build path, in build-path order, and then in
the EGL system package. The search ends as soon as a part is found.
However, if multiple on-demand <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">import</span></span> statements
reference the same part, the search results in an error.</p>
