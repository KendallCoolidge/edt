<h1 class="topictitle1">Syntax diagram for EGL statements</h1>



<div><p></p>

<p>The syntax diagrams let you see quickly how to construct an EGL
statement. Here is an example diagram:</p>

<div class="p"> <div class="fignone">
<br></br><img src="../images/cedt_core_syntax_diagrams.gif" alt="Example of a syntax diagram"></img><br></br>
</div>
</div>

<p>Read the diagram from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, following the <span class="synph"><span class="var">main
path</span></span>, which is the line that begins on the left with
double arrowheads (&gt;&gt;). As you follow the main path you may select
an entry on a subordinate path, in which case you continue reading
from left-to-right along the subordinate path.</p>

<p>In the example, the main path is composed of four line segments.
It is important to see this. The second and third line segments of
the main path each begins with a single arrowhead (&gt;) and includes
subordinate information. The fourth line segment of the main path
line also begins with a single arrowhead (&gt;), includes returning arrows
and subordinate information, and ends with two arrowheads facing each
other (&gt;&lt;).</p>

<div class="p">A term (or symbol) that is not in italics must be specified exactly
as shown. In the example, you specify the term <strong>RequiredTerm</strong> as
is. In contrast, a term in italics is a placeholder for a value that
you specify. In the example, you might include any of the following
symbols in place of <em>RequiredValue</em>: <pre class="codeblock">  myVariable
  50
  "Oh!"</pre>
</div>

<p>The specific requirements for an italicized term (for example,
whether a string or number is appropriate) are explained in the text
that follows the syntax diagram, not in the syntax diagram itself.</p>

<p>If a diagram shows a nonalphanumeric character, you type that character
as part of the syntax. After you specify a value for <span class="synph"><span class="var">RequiredValue</span></span>,
for instance, you type a colon (:) and a blank. </p>

<p>If you are allowed to select from any of several terms, the terms
are shown in a stack. In the example, you can specify the term <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">Alternative01</span></span> or <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">Alternative02</span></span>. </p>

<p>If (as in this case) you <em>must select</em> a term from those listed
in a stack, one of the choices (arbitrarily specified) is on the top
line of the stack. If you are not required to select a term, the terms
are all below the top line of the stack, as is true of <strong>OptionalTerm01</strong>.</p>

<div class="p">A value that is on a path but is shown in an elevated way (as is
true of <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">= yes</span></span>) is the default value for
the stack in which the value appears. The example indicates that you
can specify any of the following strings, and the first two are equivalent: <pre class="codeblock">optionalTerm01 = yes

optionalTerm01

optionalTerm01 = no

OptionalTerm02</pre>
</div>

<p>An arrow returning to the left above a term indicates that you
can use the term repeatedly. In the example, you specify values for <span class="synph"><span class="var">property</span></span>,
each separated from the next with a comma.</p>

<div class="p">An arrow returning to the left above a vertical stack means that
you can choose from the list of entries in any order. In the example,
each of the following strings is valid (as are other variations),
but none is required: <pre class="codeblock">  OptionalTerm04 OptionalTerm05
  OptionalTerm06
  OptionalTerm04 OptionalTerm06 OptionalTerm05
</pre>
</div>
