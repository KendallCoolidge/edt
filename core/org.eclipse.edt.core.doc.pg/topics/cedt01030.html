<h1 class="topictitle1">Resource bindings</h1>



<div id="body"><a name="body"><!-- --></a><p>One of the more elegant aspects of EGL is its
use of <dfn class="term">resource bindings</dfn>, each of which is a set of details
for accessing a service or database.</p>

<p>You maintain the bindings in an EGL deployment descriptor, which
is external from your logic. That descriptor is used when you are
running or deploying your logic and when you are debugging code in
the EGL debugger.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Service bindings</h2><div class="p">If the purpose of a resource
binding is service access, the definition is called a <dfn class="term">service
binding</dfn>, and the main detail is in one of two formats. <ul>
<li>If the service is deployed on an application server, you can specify
a Universal Resource Identifier (URI), as shown in the following example: <ul class="simple">
<li><samp class="codeph">http://myserver:8080/myproject/restservices/myservice</samp></li>

</ul>
<p>Although you can run the deployed service during an EGL debugging
session, the EGL debugger does not step into the service.</p>
</li>

<li>If the service is available in your workspace and was written
in EGL, you can use a <dfn class="term">workspace URI</dfn> , which is an identifier
that points to a workspace location. Here is an example:<ul class="simple">
<li><samp class="codeph">workspace://mySourceProject/servicepackage.serviceName</samp></li>

</ul>
<p>In this case, an internal Test Server enables you to debug
the code.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Database bindings</h2><p>If the purpose of a resource
binding is database access, the definition is called a <dfn class="term">database
binding</dfn> and includes connection detail. The binding might include
details or might reference a connection that you defined in Eclipse. </p>
<p>To
access a relational database, you include connection details directly
in your code, in the DataSource object that is referenced in database-access
statements. </p>
