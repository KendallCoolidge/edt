<h1 class="title topictitle1">Resource bindings</h1>



<div class="body" id="body"><p class="shortdesc">One of the more elegant aspects of EGL is its
use of <em class="ph i">resource bindings</em>, each of which is a value that describes
how to access a service or database. In most cases, you maintain bindings
in an EGL deployment descriptor, which is external to your logic.
The deployment descriptor provides the access details when you are
developing or deploying your application.</p>

<p class="p">This use of the deployment descriptor is safe and flexible. You
can change the details stored there and redeploy the code without
changing the logic and without spending the time to regenerate output.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The typical process</h2><div class="p">The binding mechanism
equivalent for accessing a service or database. The typical process
is as follows: <ol class="ol">
<li class="li">Write a resource binding in an EGL deployment descriptor.</li>

<li class="li">Relate a variable to the stored resource binding in either of
two ways: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">By invoking the<strong class="ph b">Resources.getResource</strong> function; or</li>

<li class="li">By writing a <strong class="ph b">Resource</strong> annotation.</li>

</ul>
<p class="p">A variable that includes binding detail is called a <strong class="ph b">binding
variable</strong>.</p>
</li>

<li class="li">Place the binding variable in an EGL statement. If you are accessing
external logic, use the <strong class="ph b">call</strong> statement. If you are accessing
a database, use one of the statements that read or write data; for
example, the <strong class="ph b">add</strong> or <strong class="ph b">get</strong> statement.</li>

</ol>
</div>
<div class="p">Here is an example use of the <strong class="ph b">Resources.getResource</strong> function,
which can be invoked only inside an EGL function: <pre class="pre codeblock">myBindingVar HttpRest? = Resources.getResource("binding:myEntry");
</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">The function call requires a single argument, which
identifies an entry in the EGL deployment descriptor.</p>
<div class="p">Here is
an example use of the equivalent <strong class="ph b">Resource</strong> annotation, which
you can specify anywhere that you can declare a variable:<pre class="pre codeblock">myBindingVar HttpRest?{@Resource{uri="binding:myEntry"}};
</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">The <strong class="ph b">uri</strong> annotation field is optional and
refers by default to a resource binding that has the same name as
the binding variable. For example, the missing value for the <strong class="ph b">uri</strong> field
in the following annotation is <samp class="ph codeph">"binding:myBindingVar"</samp>:<pre class="pre codeblock">myBindingVar HttpRest{@Resource};</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">Whether
you specify the <strong class="ph b">Resources.getResource</strong> function or <strong class="ph b">Resource</strong> annotation,
you can use an extended format ("binding:file:<em class="ph i">fileName</em>#<em class="ph i">entry</em>")
to identify the EGL deployment descriptor that contains the entry.
Here is an example:<pre class="pre codeblock">myBindingVar HttpRest? = Resources.getResource("binding:file:myDDFile#myEntry"); 

// equivalent annotation
myBindingVar HttpRest?{@Resource{uri = "binding:file:myDDFile#myEntry"}};</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">If
you do not use the extended format, the referenced EGL deployment
descriptor is as follows:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">At development time, the code is referencing the development deployment
descriptor. That descriptor is the one that is identified in the following
project property: <strong class="ph b">Development Deployment Descriptor</strong>.</li>

<li class="li">At deployment time, the code is referencing the deployment descriptor
that you deploy.</li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Bindings in your code</h2><div class="p">A resource binding
includes a series of fields that are characteristic of a particular
type of binding. For example, a REST service binding has fields that
are different from those in an SQL database binding. The existence
of binding types means that you can go beyond the typical process
described earlier:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">You might define a variable that is of the appropriate binding
type. You can assign field values to that variable and use the variable
for resource access. In this case, the resource binding is solely
in your code.</li>

<li class="li">In relation to service bindings, you can initialize the variable
with values from the EGL deployment descriptor and then update the
fields in your code.</li>

</ul>
     </div>
