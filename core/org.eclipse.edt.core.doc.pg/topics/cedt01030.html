<h1 class="topictitle1">Resource bindings</h1>



<div id="body"><a name="body"><!-- --></a><p>One of the more elegant aspects of EGL is its
use of <dfn class="term">resource bindings</dfn>, each of which is a value that
describes how to access a service or database. The bindings are maintained
in an EGL deployment descriptor, which is external to your logic and
provides the access details when you are developing or deploying your
application.</p>

<p>This use of the deployment descriptor is safe and flexible. You
can change the details stored there and then redeploy the code without
changing the access logic and without spending the time to regenerate
output.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Service bindings</h2><div class="p">If the purpose of a resource
binding is service access, the definition is called a <dfn class="term">service
binding</dfn>, and the main detail is in one of two formats. <ul>
<li>If the service is deployed on an application server, you can specify
a Universal Resource Identifier (URI), as shown in the following example: <ul class="simple">
<li><samp class="codeph">http://myserver:8080/myproject/restservices/myservice</samp></li>

</ul>
<p>Although you can run the deployed service during an EGL debugging
session, the EGL debugger does not step into the service.</p>
</li>

<li>If the service is available in your workspace and was written
in EGL, you can use a <dfn class="term">workspace URI</dfn> , which is an identifier
that points to a workspace location. Here is an example:<ul class="simple">
<li><samp class="codeph">workspace://mySourceProject/servicepackage.serviceName</samp></li>

</ul>
<p>In this case, an internal Test Server enables you to debug
the code, and the URI is useful only at development time. The Test
Server is described here: <a href="cedt01031.html" title="EGL uses a test server to invoke services from the service logic in your workspace rather than from a deployment site. The server is based on Jetty technology, which is described here:">EGL test server</a>.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Database bindings</h2><p>If the purpose of a resource
binding is to specify the connection used for database access, the
definition is called a <dfn class="term">database binding</dfn>. You can place
the binding in the EGL deployment descriptor, but can include the
connection information directly in your code.</p>
<p>For further details,
see <a href="cedt01029.html" title="When you work with EGL, many of the details of data access are in variables that you customize for inclusion in statements such as add or delete. The customized variables include details that are specific to a particular kind of data store, whether the kind is a relational database; a file; or, in the future, some other form of persistent storage. By including the kind-specific detail in a variable rather than in the statement itself, the EGL design allows most data-access statements to be structured in a particular way, regardless of which kind of data store is accessed.">EGL support for relational databases</a>.</p>
