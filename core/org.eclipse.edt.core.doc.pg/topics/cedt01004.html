<h1 class="topictitle1">Service access in Rich UI</h1>



<div><p>Service access in an EGL Rich UI handler or library is
always <dfn class="term"> asynchronous</dfn>: the requester continues running
without waiting for a response from the service. The user can still
interact with the user interface while the requester waits for the
service to respond.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="p">The following code accesses the implementation that is
shown in “EGL support for SOA”:<pre class="codeblock">myService MyServiceType?{@Resource{bindingKey = """"""""MyBinding""""""""}};

call myService.myEcho(""""""""world"""""""")
     returning to myCallBack
     onException serviceLib.serviceExceptionHandler;</pre>
</div>
<p>The
first statement accesses an instance of a binding that is created
from the specified entry in an EGL deployment descriptor. The second
statement uses that binding detail in an invocation.</p>
<p>After the
invocation, the service does a task and, in most cases, responds to
the EGL runtime code. The EGL runtime code then invokes a callback
function. A callback function is a Rich UI function that you code
and that you specify in the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">call</span></span> statement
that accesses the service. The invocation by the EGL runtime code
is described as <dfn class="term">issuing a callback</dfn>. If an error occurs
during service access and you have specified an exception handler
in the <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">call</span></span> statement, the EGL runtime code
invokes the exception handler.</p>
<p>In the previous example, the <samp class="codeph">myCallBack</samp> callback
function (not shown) receives the text that is returned from a service
and places it on the web page at run time.</p>
<div class="p">Typically, the process
for accessing services from Rich UI is as follows:<ol>
<li>Use a workbench tool to create an EGL Interface part that describes
the service operations. For a given operation, the part identifies
the return value and argument list.</li>

<li>Create an access variable that is based on the Interface part.</li>

<li>Use the variable in a <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">call</span></span> statement.
The <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">call</span></span> statement includes the details
that the EGL runtime code needs in order to issue a callback and specify
an exception handler, which is invoked at run time if the invocation
fails. </li>

</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Rich UI proxy</h2><p>To access a service, a Rich
UI application uses the Rich UI proxy. The Rich UI proxy is runtime
software that is installed with your code on an application server
that is compliant with Java EE. </p>
<div class="p">The <dfn class="term">EGL
Rich UI proxy</dfn> is runtime software that is installed with your
Rich UI code, which runs on an application server that is compliant
with Java EE. The proxy handles
the communication between the application and any services that are
accessed by the application:<ul>
<li>When a SOAP service is requested, the proxy receives the request
from the application, reads a WSDL file on the server, formats a SOAP
message for transmission to the service, and sends a service request.
When the service sends a response, the proxy reformats that response
for use in the callback function and sends the response to the application.</li>

<li>When another kind of service is requested, the process is similar
but simpler. No WSDL file is involved.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>The Rich UI application uses the EGL Rich UI proxy to
access every invoked service, even services that are on the same server. </p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Services that can be accessed from Rich UI</h2><div class="p">Your
Rich UI application can access the following kinds of services:<ul>
<li>A web service, including an EGL REST-RPC service</li>

<li>An EGL service that is deployed as a <dfn class="term">dedicated service</dfn>,
which is available to the other logic in the Rich UI application.
That service is local to the Rich UI proxy and runs in the application
server that transmitted the Rich UI application. <p>You can use the
dedicated service to do tasks that other EGL-generated Java services can do, such as accessing a database,
or <strong>(in a later version of EDT)</strong> a file system or a local IBM i service program. However,
the dedicated service is not available to other code unless you redeploy
it as a SOAP or EGL REST-RPC service.</p>
</li>
