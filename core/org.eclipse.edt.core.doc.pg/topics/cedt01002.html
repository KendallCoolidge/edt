<h1 class="topictitle1">EGL support for Rich Internet Applications</h1>



<div><p>This section gives an overview of EGL support for Rich
Internet Applications.</p>


<p>EGL Rich UI is a technology for writing applications that will
be deployed on application servers. The technology builds on an idea
central to EGL: write simple code, which is converted automatically
to output that is useful for running a business. The output in this
case is client-side JavaScript,
called <em>client-side</em> because the JavaScript runs in the browser, not on
the remote machine that serves the web page. Client-side JavaScript is important because it makes
the web page more responsive, providing greater flexibility so that
the user's experience can go beyond receiving and submitting a page.
After the user clicks a radio button, for example, the logic might
respond by changing the content of a text box. The change occurs quickly
because the JavaScript runs
locally and, in most cases, redraws only one area of the page.</p>

<p>An extension of client-side JavaScript is <em>Ajax</em>,
a technology that permits the runtime invocation of remote code and
the subsequent update of a portion of a web page, even as the user
continues working elsewhere on the page. After the user selects a
purchase order from a list box, for example, the JavaScript logic might request transmission
of order-item details from the remote web server and then place those
details in a table displayed to the user. In this way, the application
can access content from the server but can save time by selecting,
at run time, which content is transmitted.</p>

<div class="p">A developer writes Rich UI applications using EGL syntax. For advanced
purposes, however, a developer can write custom JavaScript or use external JavaScript libraries instead of relying
on the default behavior provided by EGL. For example, you can use
Rich UI to access the following software:<ul>
<li>The Dojo Toolkit (<a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">http://dojotoolkit.org/</a>)</li>

<li>Microsoft Silverlight (<a href="http://silverlight.net/">http://silverlight.net/</a>)</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">A Rich UI application can act as the front end for services that
access databases and do other complex processing. You can access the
following kinds of services, as noted in “EGL support for SOA”:<ul>
<li>SOAP web services.</li>

<li>REST web services that are provided by third parties such as Yahoo
and Google.</li>

<li>EGL REST-RPC services.</li>

<li>EGL dedicated services.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>You deploy the output of a Rich UI application to an EGL web project
or to a non-EGL dynamic web project. The project might be configured
for an application server such as WebSphere Application
Server, which is fully compliant with Java EE,
or for an application server such as Apache Tomcat, which is partially
compliant with Java EE.</p>

<div class="p">Keystroke details are available:<ul>
<li>For development, see <a href="../../org.eclipse.edt.ide.doc/topics/tedt00560.html" title="You can use the EGL Rich UI editor to modify a Rich UI handler and to preview the handler's runtime behavior.">Using the EGL Rich UI editor</a>,</li>

<li>For deployment, see <a href="../../org.eclipse.edt.ide.doc/topics/tedt00537.html" title="You can update the EGL deployment descriptor with details that are needed to deploy Rich UI applications.">Adding Rich UI deployment details to the EGL deployment descriptor</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Also, the topics subordinate to this one provide much detail on
the programming model.</p>
