<h1 class="title topictitle1">Accessing a BIRT report</h1>



<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (BIRT) is an
Eclipse-based reporting system that allows for sophisticated output
in PDF or HTML format, including graphics, tables, graphs, and charts.
EGL support for BIRT is will be available when you code programs generated
for Java™; but <strong class="ph b">that support
is not available in version .7 of the Eclipse IDE for EGL Developers</strong>.</p>

<p class="p">You can begin designing your output by opening the Report Design
perspective of the Workbench and creating a Report project. Alternatively,
you can do all your work in an EGL or web project. </p>

<div class="p">You create a <em class="ph i">report</em>, which (in the context of your output-design
work) is an XML file whose default extension is .rptdesign. The steps
are as follows: <ol class="ol">
<li class="li">Click <span class="keyword">File</span> or right click on the project</li>

<li class="li">Select <span class="keyword">New</span> &gt; <span class="keyword">Other</span></li>

<li class="li">At the <span class="keyword">Select a Wizard</span> dialog, choose <span class="keyword">Business
Intelligence and Reporting Tools</span> &gt; <span class="keyword">Report</span></li>

<li class="li">Specify a parent folder and report name, and click <span class="keyword">Next</span></li>

<li class="li">At the <span class="keyword">New Report</span> dialog, select a template
that will be the basis of your report. Help is available if you press
the question icon, and details on report design will be displayed
subsequently if you check <span class="keyword">Show Report Creation Cheat Sheet</span>. </li>

<li class="li">Click <span class="keyword">Finish</span>.</li>

<li class="li">Your subsequent tasks include specifying a data source (for example,
a JDBC connection), specifying a data set (for example, the database
columns specified in an SQL SELECT statement), and using a palette
to drag and drop elements such as labels and tables. You can rely
on the cheat sheet and can get a fuller introduction to report design
by accessing the tutorial and background detail at the following website:<p class="lines">  <a class="xref" href="http://www.eclipse.org/birt">http://www.eclipse.org/birt</a></p>
</li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="p">Working at the EGL or web perspective, you create EGL code that
drives output creation. The creation can have two steps:<ol class="ol">
<li class="li">The report (hereafter called the <em class="ph i">design file</em>) is converted
to a second file, called a <em class="ph i">document file</em>, which has a default
extension of .rptdocument and contains data in an intermediate format</li>

<li class="li">The document file is converted to the PDF or HTML output</li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="p">Two other choices are possible, to speed processing:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">You can skip the creation of a separate document file</li>

<li class="li">You can start the process with an existing document file instead
of a design file</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">The basic idea for working with BIRT in EGL is as follows: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">You create an <em class="ph i"> EGL BIRT report</em>, which is a variable based
on BIRTReport, an external type. You can include various details (name
of a design file, for example) when declaring that variable, or you
can avoid specifying some or all of the details and add them later
by invoking functions or setting fields that are specific to the EGL
BIRT report. In either case, you can specify the details at development
time, by using literals, or at run time, by using variables.<div class="p">Here's
an example of the syntax that first creates an EGL BIRT report and
then specifies the fully qualified name of the design file:<pre class="pre codeblock">  myReport BIRTReport { };
  myReport.designFile = "C:/MyBIRTReport.rptdesign";</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li class="li">You invoke a function that creates the output, as in the following
example:<pre class="pre codeblock">  myReport.createReportFromDesign();</pre>
<div class="p">The
following creation functions are available:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">createReportFromDesign() creates output from a design file, without
storing the report data in a document file</li>

<li class="li">createReportFromDocument() creates output from a document file</li>

<li class="li">createDocument() creates a document file from a design file</li>

</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li class="li">You can create an EGL report handler of type BIRTHandler. This
optional logic part contains functions that act as event handlers,
allowing you to customize many details that affect the report output.
When EGL is creating a report document (as is possible with createDocument
or createReportFromDesign), the EGL runtime code invokes the event
handlers in response to the following events, among others: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">The opening or closing of a text file or database connection</li>

<li class="li">The opening or closing of a database cursor</li>

<li class="li">The retrieving of a row of database data into report fields</li>

<li class="li">The creation of a report element such as a label or grid</li>

</ul>
<div class="p">An event handler might (for example) accomplish one of the
following tasks:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Specify the value of a report parameter that guides some aspect
of report processing</li>

<li class="li">Specify a user ID and password for connecting to a database </li>

<li class="li">Set up an SQL SELECT statement to guide data retrieval from the
database </li>

<li class="li">Act as an intermediary, receiving displayable data from your EGL
program and then providing that data to the report engine at the appropriate
time </li>

<li class="li">Change report formatting and text in response to a specific value
being placed into the report</li>

</ul>
</div>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="p">You can use a cascading style sheet (CSS) to control display characteristics
of the report.</p>
