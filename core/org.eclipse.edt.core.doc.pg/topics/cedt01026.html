<h1 class="topictitle1">Drag and drop in EGL Rich UI applications</h1>


<div>
<p>You can write code so that a user is able to drag a widget from
one location and drop it at another. More broadly, your code can respond
to the following user events: a single mouse-down event when the user
holds the position; subsequent mouse-move events; and a single mouse-up
event. You can fulfill any runtime tasks that are represented by the
drag and drop; Rich UI does not define the behavior.</p>

<div class="p">You write the drag-and-drop code by specifying three properties
in a widget declaration and by writing functions that are referenced
in the corresponding property values. For example, here is the declaration
of a button:<pre class="codeblock">b1 Button { 
   text = "Button 1", position="absolute",	x=10, y=10,
   <strong>onStartDrag = start, onDrag = drag, onDropOnTarget = drop</strong>};
</pre>
</div>

<p>Here are the three properties that make drag-and-drop possible:</p>

<ul>
<li> <samp class="codeph">onStartDrag</samp> references a function that the EGL
Runtime calls once, at the start of a drag operation. The function
has characteristics that are shown in the following Delegate part:<pre class="codeblock">Delegate StartDragFunction(widget Widget in, 
                           x int in, y int in) returns (Boolean)</pre>
<p>The
function receives a reference to the widget and receives the absolute
x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer. The function returns a Boolean
value that indicates whether to continue the drag operation.</p>
</li>

<li><samp class="codeph">onDrag</samp> references a function that the EGL Runtime
calls repeatedly, as the drag operation proceeds; specifically, each
time the browser records a mouse-move event. The function has characteristics
that are shown in the following Delegate part:<pre class="codeblock">Delegate DragFunction(widget Widget in, 
                      dropTarget Widget in, 
                      x int in, y int in) </pre>
<p>The function
receives references to the widget being dragged and to the widget
(if any) over which the mouse pointer is passing. If the mouse pointer
is not passing over any widget, the second argument is null. The function
also receives the absolute x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer
and has no return value. The function itself should update the position
of the widget (or some other image) in response to the mouse-move
event.</p>
</li>

<li> <samp class="codeph">onDropOnTarget</samp> references a function that the
EGL Runtime calls once, when the user releases the mouse to end the
drag operation. The function has characteristics that are shown in
the following Delegate part:<pre class="codeblock">Delegate DropOnTargetFunction(widget Widget in,
                      dropTarget Widget in,
                      x int in, y int in) </pre>
<p>The function
receives references to the widget being dropped and to the widget
(if any) under the mouse pointer. If no widget is under the mouse
pointer, the second argument is null. The function also receives the
absolute x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer and has no return
value.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<div class="p">Here is an example you can bring into your workspace:.<pre class="codeblock">import com.ibm.egl.rui.widgets.TextField;

handler MyHandler type RUIHandler{initialUI =[myTextField]}
   myTextField TextField{text = 
                   "What a drag!", position = "absolute", x = 110, y = 210, width = 120, 
                   onStartDrag = start, onDrag = drag, onDropOnTarget = drop};
   dx, dy int;

   function start(myWidget Widget in, x int in, y int in) returns(boolean)
      dx = x - myWidget.x;
      dy = y - myWidget.y;
      return(true);
   end

   function drag(myWidget Widget in, drop Widget in, x int in, y int in)
      myWidget.x = x - dx;
      myWidget.y = y - dy;
   end

   function drop(widget Widget in, drop Widget in, x int in, y int in)
   end
end  </pre>
</div>

<div class="p">The <samp class="codeph">start</samp> function calculates the difference between
the location of the mouse pointer and the top-left corner of the widget.
The effect of using that calculation is that the mouse pointer is
displayed at the same place on the widget throughout the operation.
To see the effect, run the code twice, clicking the <em>bottom-right
corner</em> of the widget to start the drag-and-drop operation each
time:<ol>
<li>Run the code as shown</li>

<li>Run the code only after replacing the statements in the <samp class="codeph">drag</samp> function
with the following assignments:<pre class="codeblock">   myWidget.x = x;
   myWidget.y = y;
</pre>
</li>

</ol>
</div>
