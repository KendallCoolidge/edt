<h1 class="topictitle1">EGL support for relational databases</h1>


<div><p>When you work with EGL, many of the details of data access
are in variables that you customize for inclusion in statements such
as <strong>add</strong> or <strong>delete</strong>. The customized variables include details
that are specific to a particular kind of data store, whether the
kind is a relational database; a file; or, in the future, some other
form of persistent storage. By including the kind-specific detail
in a variable rather than in the statement itself, the EGL design
allows most data-access statements to be structured in a particular
way, regardless of which kind of data store is accessed.</p>

<div class="p">Most of the customized variables that you use for relational database
access are based on the following types:<ul>
<li>SQLDataSource, which represents a database connection. </li>

<li>SQLResultSet, which represents a result set returned from an SQL
query.</li>

<li>SQLStatement, which represents an SQL statement that is produced
by issuing the EGL <strong>Prepare</strong> statement. This kind of SQL statement
is a <dfn class="term">prepared statement</dfn>. It is structured from a string
at run time and often has characteristics that are known only at run
time.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">Much information on EGL support for relational databases is in
the EGL Language Reference:<ul>
<li>For details on the types listed earlier, see the description of
the eglx.persistence.sql package. </li>

<li>For details on the data-access statements, see the statement-specific
topics.</li>
