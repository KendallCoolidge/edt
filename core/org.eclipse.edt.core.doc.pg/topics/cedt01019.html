<h1 class="title topictitle1">Event handling in Rich UI</h1>


<div class="body">
<p class="p">Every widget includes a set of properties for specifying which
function is invoked in response to a runtime event. The function in
this case is also called an <em class="ph i">event handler</em>.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Events</h2><p class="p">The next table lists the available
events, though widgets of specific types respond to specific events.
For example, buttons respond to onClick, but not to onChange. Also
note that two user actions involve "gaining the focus" (by tabbing
to or selecting the widget) or "losing the focus" (by tabbing to or
selecting a different widget).</p>

<div class="p">The following syntax, for example, declares a Button
widget, and the function named click is invoked when the user clicks
the widget:<pre class="pre codeblock">myButton Button { text = "Copy Input to Output", onClick ::= click };</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">The
operator <samp class="ph codeph">::=</samp> appends the function named click to
a dynamic array. One implication is that, when you declare the widget,
a set of event-related arrays is immediately available to you, with
each array named for an event.</p>
<div class="p">If you specify multiple event
handlers for a given event, the order in which the event handlers
will run is the order of elements in the array. Here is an example
of the syntax: <pre class="pre codeblock">myButton Button { text = "Start", onClick ::= click, onClick ::= function02 };</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">You
can also use the operator <samp class="ph codeph">::=</samp> in your code, to add
event handlers to the dynamic array. Here is an example: <pre class="pre codeblock">myButton.onClick ::= function03;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="p">In this examples, a user click causes the invocation
of the functions click, then function02, then function03.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Event record</h2><div class="p">Each event handler receives
a record that provides details about the event. The event record is
of type Event and includes the following fields:<dl class="dl parml">
<dt class="dt pt dlterm">ch INT</dt>

<dd class="dd pd">The ASCII code for the keystroke, if any, that caused the event.</dd>


<dt class="dt pt dlterm">x INT</dt>

<dd class="dd pd">The x coordinate (in pixels) relative to the left of a given widget.
For example, if the user clicks in the exact middle of a button that
is 10 by 10, the value of x is 5.</dd>


<dt class="dt pt dlterm">y INT</dt>

<dd class="dd pd">The y coordinate (in pixels) relative to the top of a given widget.
For example, if the user clicks in the exact middle of a button that
is 10 by 10, the value of y is 5.</dd>


<dt class="dt pt dlterm">clientX INT</dt>

<dd class="dd pd">The x coordinate of the mouse pointer (in pixels) relative to
the left of the browser window. For example, if two buttons, each
10 by 10, are side-by-side at the top left of the browser window and
the user clicks the exact middle of the second, the value of x is
15.</dd>


<dt class="dt pt dlterm">clientY INT</dt>

<dd class="dd pd">The y coordinate of the mouse pointer (in pixels) relative to
the top of the browser window. For example, if two buttons, each 10
by 10, are side-by-side at the top left of the browser window and
the user clicks the exact middle of the second, the value of y is
5.</dd>


<dt class="dt pt dlterm">screenX INT</dt>

<dd class="dd pd">The x coordinate of the mouse pointer (in pixels) relative to
the left of the screen. The value varies in accordance with the display
resolution of the workstation.</dd>


<dt class="dt pt dlterm">screenY INT</dt>

<dd class="dd pd">The y coordinate of the mouse pointer (in pixels) relative to
the top of the screen. The value varies in accordance with the display
resolution of the workstation.</dd>


<dt class="dt pt dlterm">widget ANY</dt>

<dd class="dd pd">The widget to which the event is attached.</dd>


<dt class="dt pt dlterm">mousebutton INT</dt>

<dd class="dd pd">A number that indicates which mouse button was pressed.</dd>

</dl>
</div>
<div class="p">The record of type Event also includes the
following functions, each of which is without parameters:<dl class="dl parml">

<dt class="dt pt dlterm">preventDefault()</dt>

<dd class="dd pd">Prevents the browser from fulfilling a default behavior. For example,
you might want to avoid the typical result of a user's clicking a
hypertext link. In the following outline, the user's click is passed
to the browser only if a specified condition is in effect: <pre class="pre codeblock">hLink HyperLink { text = "www.ibm.com", 
                  href = "http://www.ibm.com", 
                  onClick ::= handleClickLink };

function handleClickLink(e Event in)
   
   // allow access only to personnel with an explicitly specified status
   if (...)
      return;
   end
   e.preventDefault();
end</pre>
</dd>


<dt class="dt pt dlterm">stopPropagation()</dt>

<dd class="dd pd">Used by Rich UI event definitions to cause a behavior that is
described in “Event propagation.”</dd>

</dl>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Event propagation</h2><p class="p">When a widget within a
container does not have a set of event handlers of a given type, the
event is made available to the container. For example, if a button
is within a box (named B) and if the button does not handle an onClick
event, the event is made available to B. This behavior is called <dfn class="term">event
propagation</dfn>, and it extends to containers of containers, to
any level in a container hierarchy. For example, if B is itself within
a box (A) and if neither the button nor B handles the onClick event,
the event is made available to A.</p>
<p class="p">After an event <em class="ph i">is</em> handled
by a widget at any level in a container hierarchy, the event does
not propagate to an embedding widget. </p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Custom event types</h2><p class="p">Rich UI provides a way
for you to define event types that are specific to your organization.
For details, see “Extending the Rich UI widget set”; in particular,
the reference to the <strong class="ph b">VEEvent</strong> annotation.</p>
