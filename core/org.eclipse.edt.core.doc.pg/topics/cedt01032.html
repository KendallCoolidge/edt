<h1 class="topictitle1">Service bindings</h1>


<div id="body"><a name="body"><!-- --></a><p>If the purpose of a resource binding is service
access, the definition is called a <dfn class="term">service binding</dfn>. The
main detail is in one of three categories:</p>

<div class="p"><ul>
<li>If the service is deployed on an application server, you can specify
a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) that begins with the http: or
https: prefix. Here is an example:<ul class="simple">
<li><samp class="codeph">http://myserver:8080/myproject/restservices/myservice</samp></li>

</ul>
<p>Although you can run the deployed service during an EGL debugging
session, the EGL debugger does not step into the service.</p>
</li>

<li>If the service is available in your workspace and was written
in EGL, you can use a <dfn class="term">workspace URI</dfn> , which is an identifier
that points to a workspace location. Here is an example:<ul class="simple">
<li><samp class="codeph">workspace://mySourceProject/servicepackage.myservice</samp></li>

</ul>
<p>A workspace URI is useful only at development time, and an
internal Test Server enables you to debug the code. The Test Server
is described here: <a href="cedt01031.html" title="EGL uses a test server to invoke services from the service logic in your workspace rather than from a deployment site. The server is based on Jetty technology, which is described here:">EGL test server</a>.</p>
<div class="p"><div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> In
this case, your task in the EGL Deployment Descriptor editor is twofold:
to update the Service Deployment tab as well as the Resource Bindings
tab. You must arrange for service deployment.</div>
</div>
</li>

<li>If a Rich UI application includes a Service type that will be
deployed as a dedicated service, an Internal Test Server enables you
to debug the code. In this case, the EGL deployment descriptor is
never used. The only binding detail is the <strong>DedicatedService</strong> annotation,
which is part of the service-access variable declaration.<div class="p">If a Service
part named <samp class="codeph">MyServiceType</samp> is a dedicated service,
the declaration might be as follows:  <pre class="codeblock">myService MyServiceType {@DedicatedService};</pre>
</div>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Defining a service binding in the EGL deployment descriptor</h2><p>At
this writing, you can bind to a REST or EGL REST-RPC service. The
distinctions among the service types are explained here: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/edt/papers/topics/egl_soa_overview.html " target="_blank">Service-oriented architecture (SOA) for EGL developers
(http://www.eclipse.org/edt/papers/topics/egl_soa_overview.html)</a>.</p>
<p>For
details on defining a service binding in the EGL deployment descriptor,
see <a href="../../org.eclipse.edt.ide.doc/topics/tedt00539.html" title="A REST service binding gives details necessary to access a REST or EGL REST-RPC service.">Adding a REST binding to the EGL deployment descriptor</a>.</p>
<p>If
you are defining a workspace binding, you must also deploy the Service
type. For details, see <a href="../../org.eclipse.edt.ide.doc/topics/tedt00536.html" title="You can update the EGL deployment descriptor with details that are needed to deploy SOAP and EGL REST-RPC services.">Adding web-service deployment details to the EGL deployment descriptor</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Retrieving one or another service binding in your
code</h2><div class="p">You can rebind a service-access variable, as shown
here:<pre class="codeblock">myService MyInterfaceType?; 

   /* that declaration could have included 
      a Resource annotation, as shown here:

      myService MyInterfaceType? 
         { @Resource {uri=""""""""binding:MyGermanBinding""""""""} };    */

if ( ... )
   myService = SysLib.getResource(""""""""binding:MyEnglishBinding"""""""");
else
   myService = SysLib.getResource(""""""""binding:MyFrenchBinding"""""""");
end

/* here, you can access the service operations of 
   one or the other service, assuming that the two 
   have similar interfaces.                             */    </pre>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Retrieving a service binding and changing it in your
code</h2><div class="p">Here is an example of preparing a variable and then
using it to access a third-party REST service:<pre class="codeblock">myService MyServiceType?;
http HttpRest{@Resource{uri=""""""""binding:myService""""""""}};        
http.request.encoding = encoding.json;
call myService.myFunction() using http returning to myCallBackFunction
                                       onException myExceptionHandler;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">The code acts as follows: <ol>
<li>Declares an access variable.  <p>The declaration references an
Interface type that typically includes one or more uriTemplate annotation
fields, each of which is a set of lower-level URI qualifiers that
are resolved at run time. A resolved template might be this: <samp class="codeph">/GetWeatherByZipCode?zipCode=27709</samp></p>
</li>

<li>Accesses a new instance of an HTTPRest object.<p>That object provides
a higher-level URI such as <samp class="codeph">http://www.example.com/myproject/restservices/weather_service</samp>.
 </p>
<p>In this case, the object contains details that are retrieved
from a service binding in the EGL deployment descriptor. If you do
not specify a <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">uri</span></span> annotation field, the
name of the service binding is assumed to be the name of the variable.
In the example, the value of the annotation field defaults to <samp class="codeph">""""""""binding:http""""""""</samp>. </p>
<p>For
details on the HttpRest object, see the help topic named """"""""eglx.http
package.""""""""</p>
</li>

<li>Adds detail to the HTTPRest object; for example, to ensure that
data is transferred to and from the service in JSON format.</li>

<li>Uses the HTTPRest object when calling the service.</li>

</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Creating a service binding in your code</h2><div class="p">You
can create a service binding in your code, in which case the EGL deployment
descriptor is not involved. For example, you might substitute the
second statement in the following code for the object declaration
that was shown in the preceding section: <pre class="codeblock">myService IMyService?; 
http HttpRest = new HttpRest{
   restType = eglx.rest.ServiceType.TrueRest, 
   uri = """"""""www.example.com/myproject/restservices/weather_service""""""""};
myBinding.request.encoding = Encoding.json;
call myService.myFunction() using http returning to myCallBackFunction
                                       onException myExceptionHandler;
</pre>
</div>

see the help topic named """"""""eglx.http package.""""""""</p>
