<h1 class="topictitle1">Service bindings</h1>


<div id="body"><a name="body"><!-- --></a><p>If the purpose of a resource binding is service
access, the definition is called a <dfn class="term">service binding</dfn>. The
main detail is in one of three categories:</p>

<div class="p"><ul>
<li>If the service is deployed on an application server, you can specify
a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) that begins with the http: or
https: prefix. Here is an example:<ul class="simple">
<li><samp class="codeph">http://myserver:8080/myproject/restservices/myservice</samp></li>

</ul>
<p>Although you can run the deployed service during an EGL debugging
session, the EGL debugger does not step into the service.</p>
</li>

<li>If the service is available in your workspace and was written
in EGL, you can use a <dfn class="term">workspace URI</dfn> , which is an identifier
that points to a workspace location. Here is an example:<ul class="simple">
<li><samp class="codeph">workspace://mySourceProject/servicepackage.myservice</samp></li>

</ul>
<p>A workspace URI is useful only at development time, and an
internal Test Server enables you to debug the code. The Test Server
is described here: <a href="cedt01031.html" title="EGL uses a test server to invoke services from the service logic in your workspace rather than from a deployment site. The server is based on Jetty technology, which is described here:">EGL test server</a>.</p>
<div class="p"><div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> In
this case, your task in the EGL Deployment Descriptor editor is twofold:
to update the Service Deployment tab as well as the Resource Bindings
tab. You must arrange for service deployment.</div>
</div>
</li>

<li>If a Rich UI application includes a Service type that will be
deployed as a dedicated service, an Internal Test Server enables you
to debug the code. <div class="p">In this case, the EGL deployment descriptor
is never used. You declare a binding variable of type <samp class="codeph">HttpProxy</samp> and
issue a <strong>call</strong> statement, as shown here:<pre class="codeblock">myBindingVar HttpProxy;
call MyInterface.myOperation() using myBindingVar
                               returning to myCallBackFunction
                               onException myExceptionHandler;</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">Here
is alternative code that has the same effect, but declares a binding-variable
value in the <strong>call</strong> statement itself: <pre class="codeblock">call MyInterface.myOperation() using new HttpProxy
                               returning to myCallBackFunction
                               onException myExceptionHandler;</pre>
</div>
 </li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Defining a service binding in the EGL deployment descriptor</h2><p>At
this writing, you can bind to a REST or EGL REST-RPC service. The
distinctions among the service types are explained here: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/edt/papers/topics/egl_soa_overview.html " target="_blank">Service-oriented architecture (SOA) for EGL developers
(http://www.eclipse.org/edt/papers/topics/egl_soa_overview.html)</a>.</p>
<p>For
details on defining a service binding in the EGL deployment descriptor,
see <a href="../../org.eclipse.edt.ide.doc/topics/tedt00539.html" title="A REST service binding gives details necessary to access a REST or EGL REST-RPC service.">Adding a REST binding to the EGL deployment descriptor</a>.</p>
<p>If
you are defining a workspace binding, you must also deploy the Service
type. For details, see <a href="../../org.eclipse.edt.ide.doc/topics/tedt00536.html" title="You can update the EGL deployment descriptor with details that are needed to deploy SOAP and EGL REST-RPC services.">Adding web-service deployment details to the EGL deployment descriptor</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Retrieving a service binding and changing it in your
code</h2><div class="p">Here is an example of preparing a binding variable
and then using it to access a third-party REST service:<pre class="codeblock">myBindingVar HttpRest{@Resource{uri=""""""""binding:myEntry""""""""}};        
myBindingVar.request.encoding = encoding.json;
myBindingVar.request.headers = new dictionary;
myBindingVar.request.headers[""""""""edt.proxy.invocation.timeout""""""""] = 6;
call MyInterfaceType.myFunction() 
   using myBindingVar
   returning to myCallBackFunction
   onException myExceptionHandler;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="p">The code acts as follows: <ol>
<li>Declares a binding variable that refers to the <strong>myEntry</strong> entry
in the deployment descriptor that is used by default. In this way,
the code is accessing a new instance of an HttpRest object.<p>For
details on the HttpRest object, see <a href="../../org.eclipse.edt.core.doc.lr/topics/redt00245.html" title="eglx.http defines an API for accessing details in HTTP messages. ">eglx.http package</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>Adds detail to the binding variable, in this example, the detail
has the following purpose: <ul>
<li>To ensure that data is transferred to and from the service in
JSON format; and</li>

<li>To establish a timeout value of 6 seconds.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Includes the binding variable in the <strong>call</strong> statement <strong>using</strong> clause.</li>

</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Creating a service binding in your code</h2><div class="p">You
can create a service binding in your code, in which case the EGL deployment
descriptor is not involved. For example, you might declare the binding
variable as shown in the next example: <pre class="codeblock">myBindingVar HttpRest = new HttpRest{
   restType = eglx.rest.ServiceType.TrueRest, 
   uri = """"""""www.example.com/myproject/restservices/weather_service""""""""};
myBindingVar.request.encoding = Encoding.json;
call MyInterfaceType.myFunction() 
   using myBindingVar
   returning to myCallBackFunction
   onException myExceptionHandler;
</pre>
</div>
<p>For details on the HttpRest object, see <a href="../../org.eclipse.edt.core.doc.lr/topics/redt00245.html" title="eglx.http defines an API for accessing details in HTTP messages. ">eglx.http package</a>.</p>
