<h1 class="title topictitle1">Developing a Rich UI application</h1>



<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc"></p>

<div class="p">As a Rich UI developer, you do the following tasks: <ol class="ol">
<li class="li">Create a Rich UI project.</li>

<li class="li">Create a handler and specify the <span class="ph synph"><span class="keyword kwd">RUIHandler</span></span> stereotype.
The logic is called a “Rich UI handler.”</li>

<li class="li">Add content to the Rich UI handler. The content includes widget
details, as well as the following kinds of logic:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Startup logic, which runs when the browser first receives the
application from an application server; and</li>

<li class="li">Event logic, which runs in response to user actions such as a
button click.</li>

</ul>
<p class="p">Both kinds of logic can access libraries, services, and other
Rich UI handlers.</p>
</li>

<li class="li">Revise and test your source code.</li>

<li class="li">When you are ready to generate and deploy your code, use the process
described in “Introduction to EGL generation and deployment” and “Overview
of Rich UI deployment.” </li>

<li class="li">When you store your applications in a corporate repository, keep
the specific EGL widget projects that were used during development.
This practice ensures that you can update your applications over time
without having to make changes to reflect changes in the system widgets.</li>

</ol>
</div>

<p class="p">When you are developing a mobile application, the main widget is
a typically a <dfn class="term">view</dfn>, which is a container widget of type
dojo.mobile.widgets.DojoMobileView. In most cases, a view has a header
area across the top, with an optional button for navigating back to
the previous view.</p>

<p class="p">If your users are accessing a Rich UI application by way of Microsoft™ Internet Explorer
8 or less, be aware of the issue described in “Rich UI memory management
for Microsoft Internet
Explorer.”</p>

<div class="section" id="tedt01001__widget_upgrade"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Outline of widget-upgrade tasks</h2><div class="p">If
you are using the EDT IDE, you can import one or both of the following
sets of widget projects when you create a Rich UI project in a workspace: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">com.ibm.egl.rui_<em class="ph i">version</em>, for the native EGL widgets.</li>

<li class="li">com.ibm.egl.rui.dojo.widgets_<em class="ph i">version</em>, for the EGL Dojo
widgets, and com.ibm.egl.rui.dojo.runtime.local_<em class="ph i">version</em>, for
the Dojo Toolkit project, which is a local installation of the Dojo
runtime code.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<p class="p">In each case, <em class="ph i">version</em> is a revision
level of the widget project. </p>
<div class="p">If you want to access widgets
that you did not request when you created a Rich UI project, or if
you want to upgrade your code to use the latest widget versions, do
as follows:<ol class="ol">
<li class="li">Import the projects of interest. [ insert details, when available
]<p class="p">Alternatively, if you are not using the
Google or AOL provider projects, you can get all the projects you
need by creating a new Rich UI project and then deleting that project.</p>
</li>

<li class="li">For each of your Rich UI projects, ensure that the EGL build path
points to the new EGL (non-Dojo) widgets and, if appropriate, to the
new Dojo runtime code. For keystroke details, see “Editing the EGL
build path.”<p class="p">In relation to the EGL Dojo widgets, access the Toolkit
or provider project that makes available a particular version of the
EGL Dojo widgets. Do not change the EGL build path in a Toolkit or
provider project, and do not change the build paths in your own projects
to refer directly to the EGL Dojo widgets.</p>
</li>

</ol>
</div>
<p class="p">Please note that when you upgrade, you need to upgrade
both the EGL widgets and the EGL Dojo projects to the most recent
versions.</p>
