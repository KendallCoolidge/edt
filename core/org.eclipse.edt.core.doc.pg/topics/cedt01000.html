<h1 class="topictitle1">Introduction to EGL</h1>



<div><p>Enterprise Generation Language (EGL) is a programming language
and supporting technology that simplify software development. For
example, I/O statements such as <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">add</span></span> and <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">update</span></span> access
data that resides in different kinds of persistent data storage, from
file systems to queues to databases. The coding is similar for the
different cases.</p>

<p>EGL simplifies, but does not restrict. For example, you can access
relational databases in an easy way, as if interacting with a file
system, but you can write SQL statements to any level of complexity.
EGL typically accommodates supported technologies with this approach.
The language offers maximum convenience for commonplace tasks but
permits direct use of the technology itself for challenging tasks.</p>

<p>EGL helps you focus on a <em>nontechnical domain</em>, which is the
area of concern that made a specific coding task necessary. At this
writing the nontechnical domain is business, but the language is designed
so that future extensions might ultimately support other domains such
as scientific research. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the language supports technologies
in each of several <em>technical domains</em> such as runtime platform,
user-interface method, and integration with existing logic. The broad
range of technical support has value for project management because
developers who work on one kind of code such as data-access logic
can advise and assist those who work on another kind of code such
as user interface. </p>
