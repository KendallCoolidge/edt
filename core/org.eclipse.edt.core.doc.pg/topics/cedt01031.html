<h1 class="topictitle1">EGL test server</h1>



<div id="body"><a name="body"><!-- --></a><p>EGL uses a test server to invoke services from
the service logic in your workspace rather than from a deployment
site. The server is based on Jetty technology, which is described
here:</p>

<div class="p"><ul class="simple">
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty" target="_blank">www.eclipse.org/jetty</a></li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">Two situations cause the server to access service logic in your
workspace: <ul>
<li>The test server responds if the service binding in your EGL deployment
descriptor includes a <dfn class="term">workspace URI</dfn>, which is an identifier
that points to a workspace location. The format of the workspace URI
is as follows:<pre class="codeblock">workspace://<em>project_name</em>/<em>fully_qualified_service_name</em></pre>
<dl>

<dt class="dlterm"><var class="varname">project_name</var></dt>

<dd>The name of the EGL project that contains the EGL Service type.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm"><var class="varname">fully_qualified_service_name</var></dt>

<dd>The service name, preceded with a package name and period, if
the service is in a package.</dd>

</dl>
<div class="p">Here is an example of a workspace URI:<ul class="simple">
<li><samp class="codeph">workspace://mySourceProject/servicepackage.serviceName</samp></li>

</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li>The test server also responds if your Rich UI application invokes
a <dfn class="term">dedicated service</dfn>, which is a service that will be
deployed with the Rich UI application. To indicate that your code
is accessing a dedicated service, you specify an annotation in the
logic that references the service, as noted in <a href="tedt01017.html" title="After you code an EGL Service part, you can use that part as the basis of a service-access variable. However, this usage is deprecated.">Declaring a variable to access a dedicated or local EGL service</a>.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="p">A test server is specific to an EGL source project:<ul>
<li>When a workspace URI is in use, the source project is the one
in which the Service type resides. </li>

<li>When a dedicated service is in use, the source project is the
top-level project that contains the handler from which the service
is accessed. Here is an example, which demonstrates that the service
access can be indirect:<ul>
<li>MyProject01 includes a Rich UI handler.</li>

<li>That handler embeds and uses a second Rich UI handler, which resides
in MyProject02.</li>

<li>The second handler invokes a library function that resides in
MyProject03.</li>

<li>The library function invokes a dedicated service that is defined
in MyProject04.</li>

</ul>
<p>The test server in this example is specific to MyProject01.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The server relies on the detail in the EGL deployment descriptors
that are used at development time.  The server also relies on the
classpath that is specific to the project.</p>

<div class="p">In the workbench (<span class="uicontrol">Window &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Preferences &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EGL &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Test
Server</span>), you set preferences to indicate what to do in
the following cases:<ul>
<li>You change the project classpath. The changes will be in effect
only if the server process is terminated.</li>

<li>You are debugging a service and do a “hot code replace,” which
involves the following steps:<ol>
<li>When the debugger suspends execution on a statement, you change
the code that runs subsequent to the statement.</li>

<li>The subsequent code and the debugger behave as if the changes
had been in place before the debugging session.</li>

</ol>
<p>The Eclipse debug tooling might fail or behave incorrectly
in response to some kinds of hot code replace.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>You do not start a test server manually. However, you might need
terminate a test server; for example, if your preference settings
allow the server to continue in the cases just described. </p>

<div class="p">To terminate a test server, do as follows: <ol>
<li>Go to the Debug view of the EGL debugger.</li>

<li>Identify the test server process, which is named for the project.</li>

<li>Right click the entry for that process and click <span class="uicontrol">Terminate</span>.</li>

</ol>
