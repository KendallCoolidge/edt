<h1 class="topictitle1">EGL process from development to run time</h1>



<div><p>The following figure outlines the process by which the
EGL technology creates output from your source code.</p>

<div class="p"><div class="fignone">
<br></br><div class="imagecenter"><img class="imagecenter" src="../images/egl_core_overview.gif" alt="EGL compilation"></img></div><br></br>
</div>
</div>

<p>The developer's task is threefold: first, to write and test
source code, which includes the build step illustrated in the figure,
although that step is typically automatic; second, to generate and
prepare the code for external deployment; and third, to install the
code on one or another platform.</p>

<div class="p">Here is an overview of the technological process: <ol>

<li>The <dfn class="term">EGL compiler</dfn> acts as follows: <ol type="a">
<li>Accepts the source code (file extension <samp class="codeph">.egl</samp>).</li>

<li>Validates the code for general syntax errors.</li>

<li>Compiles the code into an intermediate representation of the logic.</li>

</ol>
<p>The compiled output is serialized and written to an output
file. The compilation and output is called an <dfn class="term">EGL build</dfn>,
and the output files are called an <dfn class="term">intermediate representation
(IR) file</dfn> (extension <samp class="codeph">.ir</samp>). In almost every
case, the IR file is written even if it includes errors.</p>
</li>

<li>The EGL compiler invokes an <dfn class="term">EGL generator</dfn>, which
acts as follows:<ol type="a">
<li>Accepts the IR file, which must be error free.</li>

<li>Scans the intermediate representation and determines whether a
generation is possible and valid. <p>This scan is called <em>pre-generation</em>.
It determines whether the IR fulfills the rules of the <dfn class="term">EGL target
system</dfn>, which is the operating environment where the logic
ultimately runs; for example, a Windows platform.</p>
</li>

<li>Generates output on the condition that no errors were found during
the pre-generation.</li>

</ol>
<p>The generated output is JavaScript or  Java source code. COBOL generation of various
kinds is available in commercial EGL extensions.</p>
<div class="p">You control
generation primarily by defining the <dfn class="term">build file</dfn>, which
is an XML file identified by the extension <samp class="codeph">.eglbld</samp>.
(This aspect of the technology is under review.) </div>
</li>
<br/>
<li>If generation succeeds, the generated output can become an input
to an <dfn class="term">EGL deployer</dfn>, which readies the generated output
for deployment on an EGL target platform. <p>You invoke the deployer
after configuring the <dfn class="term">EGL deployment descriptor</dfn>, which
is an XML file identified by the extension <samp class="codeph">.egldd</samp>.
The EGL deployment descriptor controls aspects of service deployment,
JavaScript deployment, and access of external services. </p>
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The
EGL deployment descriptor is different from the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (JEE) deployment
descriptors, which are <samp class="codeph">web.xml</samp> (for WAR files) and <samp class="codeph">application.xml</samp> (for
EAR files). </div>
</li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="p">EGL documentation refers to several stages:<ul>
<li>You write the EGL source code at <dfn class="term">development time</dfn>.</li>

<li>The EGL compiler creates the output written to IR files at <dfn class="term">compilation
time</dfn>. and an EGL generator creates the output that is specific
to an EGL target platform at <dfn class="term">generation time</dfn>. The phrase <dfn class="term">transformation
time</dfn> refers to compilation and generation time as a single
duration. </li>

<li>The EGL deployer configures the output for an EGL target platform
at <dfn class="term">internal-deployment time</dfn>.</li>

<li>The deployable output might be re-configured for the specific
runtime environment at <dfn class="term">external-deployment time</dfn>.</li>

<li>The business application runs on the target platform at <dfn class="term">run
time</dfn>.</li>

</ul>
