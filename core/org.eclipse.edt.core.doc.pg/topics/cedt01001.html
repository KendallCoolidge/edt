<h1 class="topictitle1">EGL process from development to run time</h1>



<div><p>The following figure illustrates EGL compilation, which
is the process by which the EGL technology creates output from your
source code.</p>

<div class="p"><div class="fignone">
<br></br><div class="imagecenter"><img class="imagecenter" src="../images/egl_core_overview.gif" alt="EGL compilation"></img></div><br></br>
</div>
</div>

<p>The developer's task is threefold: first, to write and test
source code, which includes the build step illustrated in the figure,
although that step is typically automatic; second, to generate and
prepare the code for external deployment; and third, to install the
code on one or another platform.</p>

<div class="p">Here is an overview of the first two steps, which are specific
to EGL technology:<ol>

<li>The <dfn class="term">EGL compiler</dfn> is invoked as you are working on
a source file. The compiler acts as follows: <ol type="a">
<li>Accepts the source code (file extension <samp class="codeph">.egl</samp>).</li>

<li>Validates the code for general syntax errors.</li>

<li>Compiles the code into an intermediate representation of the logic.</li>

</ol>
<p>When you save your file, the compiler also writes the output
to files. The compilation and output is called an <dfn class="term">EGL build</dfn>,
and the output files are called an <dfn class="term">intermediate representation
(IR) file</dfn> (extension <samp class="codeph">.ir</samp>). In almost every
case, the IR file is written even if it includes errors.</p>
</li>

<li>The EGL compiler invokes an <dfn class="term">EGL generator</dfn>, which
acts as follows:<ol type="a">
<li>Accepts the IR file, which must be error free.</li>

<li>Scans the intermediate representation and determines whether a
generation is possible and valid. <p>This scan is called <em>pre-generation</em>.
It determines whether the IR fulfills the rules of the <dfn class="term">EGL target
system</dfn>, which is the operating environment where the logic
ultimately runs; for example, a Windows platform.</p>
</li>

<li>Generates output on the condition that no errors were found during
the pre-generation.</li>

</ol>
<p>The generated output is JavaScript or  Java (tm) source code. </p>
<p></p>
</li>

<li>If generation succeeds, the generated output can become an input
to an <dfn class="term">EGL deployer</dfn>, which readies the generated output
for deployment on an EGL target platform. <p>You invoke the deployer
after configuring the <dfn class="term">EGL deployment descriptor</dfn>, which
is an XML file identified by the extension <samp class="codeph">.egldd</samp>.
The EGL deployment descriptor controls aspects of service deployment,
JavaScript deployment, and access of resources.</p>
<div class="p">The EGL deployment
descriptor is also used when you are debugging code. <ul>
<li>For an overview of service deployment and access, see <a href="cedt01003.html" title="EGL provides two kinds of support for service-oriented architecture (SOA):Â service development and service access.">EGL support for SOA</a>.</li>

<li>For an overview of JavaScript deployment, see <a href="cedt01002.html" title="This section gives an overview of EGL support for Rich Internet Applications.">EGL support for Rich Internet Applications</a>.</li>

<li>For an overview of accessing details on relational database connections,
see <a href="cedt01029.html" title="When you work with EGL, many of the details of data access are in variables that you customize for inclusion in statements such as add or delete. The customized variables include details that are specific to a particular kind of data store, whether the kind is a relational database; a file; or, in the future, some other form of persistent storage. By including the kind-specific detail in a variable rather than in the statement itself, the EGL design allows most data-access statements to be structured in a particular way, regardless of which kind of data store is accessed.">EGL support for relational databases</a>.</li>

</ul>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The
EGL deployment descriptor is different from the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (JEE) deployment
descriptors, which are <samp class="codeph">web.xml</samp> (for WAR files) and <samp class="codeph">application.xml</samp> (for
EAR files). </div>
</li>

</ol>
</div>

<div class="p">EGL documentation refers to several stages:<ul>
<li>You write the EGL source code at <dfn class="term">development time</dfn>.</li>

<li>The EGL compiler creates the output written to IR files at <dfn class="term">compilation
time</dfn>. and an EGL generator creates the output that is specific
to an EGL target platform at <dfn class="term">generation time</dfn>. The phrase <dfn class="term">transformation
time</dfn> refers to compilation and generation time as a single
duration. </li>

<li>The EGL deployer configures the output for an EGL target platform
at <dfn class="term">internal-deployment time</dfn>.</li>

<li>The deployable output might be re-configured for the specific
runtime environment at <dfn class="term">external-deployment time</dfn>.</li>

<li>The business application runs on the target platform at <dfn class="term">run
time</dfn>.</li>

</ul>
