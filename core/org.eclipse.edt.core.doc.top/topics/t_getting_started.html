<h1>Getting started with EGL Development Tools</h1>
<div><p>Enterprise Generation Language (EGL) is a programming language
and supporting technology that simplify software development. For
example, I/O statements such as <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">add</span></span> and <span class="synph"><span class="kwd">update</span></span> access
data that resides in different kinds of persistent data storage, from
file systems to queues to databases. The coding is similar for the
different cases.</p>

<p>EGL simplifies, but does not restrict. For example, you can access
relational databases in an easy way, as if interacting with a file
system, but you can write SQL statements to any level of complexity.
EGL typically accommodates supported technologies with this approach.
The language offers maximum convenience for commonplace tasks but
permits direct use of the technology itself for challenging tasks.</p>

<p>EGL helps you focus on a <em>nontechnical domain</em>, which is the
area of concern that made a specific coding task necessary. At this
writing the nontechnical domain is business, but the language is designed
so that future extensions might ultimately support other domains such
as scientific research. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the language supports technologies in each of several <em>technical
domains</em> such as runtime platform, user-interface method, and integration
with existing logic. The broad range of technical support has value
for project management because developers who work on one kind of
code such as data-access logic can advise and assist those who work
on another kind of code such as user interface. </p>
