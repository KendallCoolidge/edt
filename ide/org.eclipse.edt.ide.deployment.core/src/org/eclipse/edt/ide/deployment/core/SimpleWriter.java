/**
* This class writes indented text.  It has two modes of operation.  The default
* mode is called auto-indent mode.  In auto-indent mode, writing a { character
* causes the next line to be indented one more tab than the current line.
* Writing a } character causes the current line to be indented one less
* tab than the previous line.  Whitespace at the front of each line is
* removed in auto-indent mode.
*
* <P> If auto-indent mode is turned off, you can control tabbing manually.
* Calling pushIndent and popIndent change the amount that a line is indented.
* They work even in auto-indent mode.
*
* <P> In either mode, use the print and println methods to write output.
* 
* <P> This class is based on Dave Charboneau's TemplateWriter class from the
* DeclarativeTemplateCompiler.
