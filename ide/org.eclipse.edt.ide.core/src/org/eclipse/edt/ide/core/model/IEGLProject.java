// TODO Define exactly what an EGL Project has
/**
 * A EGL project represents a view of a project resource in terms of EGL 
 * elements such as package fragments, types, methods and fields.
 * A project may contain several package roots, which contain package fragments. 
 * A package root corresponds to an underlying folder or JAR.
 * <p>
 * Each EGL project has a EGLPath, defining which folders contain source code and
 * where required libraries are located. Each EGL project also has an output location,
 * defining where the builder writes <code>.class</code> files. A project that
 * references packages in another project can access the packages by including
 * the required project in a EGLPath entry. The EGL model will present the
 * source elements in the required project; when building, the compiler will use
 * the corresponding generated class files from the required project's output
 * location(s)). The EGLPath format is a sequence of EGLPath entries
 * describing the location and contents of package fragment roots.
 * </p>
 * EGL project elements need to be opened before they can be navigated or manipulated.
 * The children of a EGL project are the package fragment roots that are 
 * defined by the EGLPath and contained in this project (in other words, it
 * does not include package fragment roots for other projects).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients. An instance
 * of one of these handles can be created via 
 * <code>EGLCore.create(project)</code>.
