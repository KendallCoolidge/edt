 * Abstract base implementation of all eglpath container initializer.

 * Clients should subclass this class to implement a specific eglpath
 * container initializer. The subclass must have a public 0-argument
 * constructor and a concrete implementation of <code>resolve</code>.
 * <p>
 * Multiple eglpath containers can be registered, each of them declares
 * the container ID they can handle, so as to narrow the set of containers they
 * can resolve, in other words, a container initializer is guaranteed to only be 
 * activated to resolve containers which match the ID they registered onto.
 * <p>
 * In case multiple container initializers collide on the same container ID, the first
 * registered one will be invoked.
