 * Common protocol for all elements provided by the EGL model.

 * The EGL model may hand out any number of handles for each element. Handles
 * that refer to the same element are guaranteed to be equal, but not necessarily identical.
 * <p>
 * Methods annotated as "handle-only" do not require underlying elements to exist.
